## 🔄 How Exchange Rate Conversion Works

### Frontend (Invoice Creation)
```
1. User selects currency: USD
2. User enters amounts in USD
3. Invoice saved with currency: USD
4. NO exchange rate field shown
```

### Backend (Invoice Posting)
```
1. Invoice is posted to GL
2. System detects: Currency (USD) ≠ Base Currency (AED)
3. System fetches exchange rate from database
   - Date: Invoice date (2025-10-15)
   - From: USD
   - To: AED
   - Rate: 3.672500
4. Tax calculated in USD FIRST
5. Total converted to AED
6. GL entry created in AED
7. Exchange rate stored on invoice
```

### Code Flow
```
Frontend                  Backend
────────                  ───────
Create invoice in USD  →  gl_post_from_ap_balanced()
                          ├─ Calculate tax in USD
                          ├─ Fetch exchange rate (USD→AED)
                          ├─ Convert total to AED
                          ├─ Post GL in AED
                          └─ Save rate on invoice
```

## 🎯 Key Benefits

✅ **Tax Compliant**: Tax calculated in invoice currency first
