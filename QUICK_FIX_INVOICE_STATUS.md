# Quick Fix - Invoice Payment Status Not Updating

## ðŸ”´ Problem
After creating a payment, invoice status stays "UNPAID" instead of showing "PAID" or "PARTIALLY_PAID".

## âœ… Solution Applied

### 1. Added Auto-Update Signals
**File:** `finance/signals.py`

Invoices now automatically update their payment status when:
- Payment allocation is created âœ“
- Payment allocation is updated âœ“
- Payment allocation is deleted âœ“

### 2. Fixed Existing Invoice
Ran: `python fix_invoice_payment_status.py`

Result:
```
âœ“ Invoice #1: UNPAID â†’ PAID
```

## ðŸ“‹ How Status Works Now

| Situation | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| No payments | **UNPAID** |
| Partial payment | **PARTIALLY_PAID** |
| Fully paid | **PAID** |

## ðŸš€ To Activate

**Restart Django backend:**
```bash
.\start_django.bat
```

The signals will automatically handle all new payments!

## ðŸ”§ To Fix Old Invoices

If you have other invoices with wrong status:
```bash
python fix_invoice_payment_status.py
```

## âœ… Current Status

- Invoice #1: âœ“ PAID (was UNPAID)
- Future payments: âœ“ Will auto-update
- Both AR & AP: âœ“ Supported
