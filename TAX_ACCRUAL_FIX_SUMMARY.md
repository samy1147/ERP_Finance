# Corporate Tax Accrual - Quick Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed

### ✅ Issue #1: Missing Country Field
- **Problem**: Frontend didn't have a country selection
- **Fix**: Added country dropdown (UAE, KSA, Egypt, India) to the form
- **Default**: UAE (AE)

### ✅ Issue #2: Field Name Mismatch  
- **Problem**: Frontend sent `period_start/period_end`, backend expected `date_from/date_to`
- **Fix**: API service now maps field names correctly

### ✅ Issue #3: Wrong Account Code
- **Problem**: Code looked for account `2400`, but database has `2220`
- **Fix**: Changed `TAX_CORP_PAYABLE` from `2400` → `2220` in services.py

### ✅ Issue #4: Missing Tax Rules
- **Problem**: No tax rules configured for any country
- **Fix**: Created rules for UAE (9%), KSA (20%), Egypt (22.5%), India (30%)

## How to Test

1. **Refresh your browser** (the frontend should auto-reload)
2. Go to **Corporate Tax** page
3. You should now see **4 fields**:
   - Country (dropdown)
   - Period Start Date
   - Period End Date  
   - Tax Rate
4. Select a country and date range
5. Click **"Create Tax Accrual"**
6. Should succeed! ✅

## What the System Does

1. Calculates profit (Income - Expenses) for the period
2. Applies the country's tax rate (from CorporateTaxRule)
3. Creates journal entry:
   - **Debit**: Corporate Tax Expense (6900)
   - **Credit**: Corporate Tax Payable (2220)
4. Creates a CorporateTaxFiling record (status: ACCRUED)

## Files Changed

- `frontend/src/app/tax/corporate/page.tsx` - Added country field
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts` - Field mapping
- `finance/services.py` - Fixed account code
- Database - Added tax rules for 4 countries

## If You Still Get Errors

Make sure:
1. Django server is running (auto-reloads on file changes)
2. Frontend is running (should hot-reload automatically)
3. Clear browser cache if needed
