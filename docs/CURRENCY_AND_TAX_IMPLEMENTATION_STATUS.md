## ✅ What IS Implemented

### 1. Currency Selection in Invoices

**Backend API:**
```
GET /api/currencies/           - List all currencies
GET /api/currencies/{id}/      - Get specific currency
POST /api/currencies/          - Create new currency
PATCH /api/currencies/{id}/    - Update currency
DELETE /api/currencies/{id}/   - Delete currency
```

**Frontend Usage:**
```typescript
// Files that USE currencies:
- frontend/src/app/ar/invoices/new/page.tsx       ✅ AR invoice creation
- frontend/src/app/ar/invoices/[id]/edit/page.tsx ✅ AR invoice editing
- frontend/src/app/ap/invoices/new/page.tsx       ✅ AP invoice creation
- frontend/src/app/ap/invoices/[id]/edit/page.tsx ✅ AP invoice editing
- frontend/src/app/customers/page.tsx              ✅ Customer form
- frontend/src/app/suppliers/page.tsx              ✅ Supplier form

// API wrapper:
- frontend/src/services/api.ts → currenciesAPI.list() ✅ Used
```

**What Users See:**
- Dropdown in invoice forms to select currency (USD, AED, EUR, etc.)
- Dropdown in customer/supplier forms to set default currency
- Currency code displayed on invoice detail pages

**Example:**
```jsx
// In AR Invoice creation form
<div className="mb-4">
  <label>Currency</label>
  <select 
    value={formData.currency}
    onChange={(e) => setFormData({...formData, currency: e.target.value})}
  >
    {currencies.map(c => (
      <option key={c.id} value={c.id}>
        {c.code} - {c.name}
      </option>
    ))}
  </select>
</div>
```

**What's MISSING:**
- ❌ No `/currencies` page to view all currencies
- ❌ No "Add New Currency" button
- ❌ No edit/delete currency functionality
- ❌ No indication of which is base currency
- ❌ Must manage currencies via Django admin

---

### 2. Tax Rate Selection in Invoices (with Smart Filtering!)

**Backend API:**
```
GET /api/tax/rates/              - List all tax rates
GET /api/tax/rates/?country=AE   - List tax rates for country
POST /api/tax/seed-presets/      - Seed default VAT rates (not in frontend)
```

**Frontend Usage:**
```typescript
// Files that USE tax rates:
- frontend/src/app/ar/invoices/new/page.tsx       ✅ AR invoice creation
- frontend/src/app/ar/invoices/[id]/edit/page.tsx ✅ AR invoice editing
- frontend/src/app/ap/invoices/new/page.tsx       ✅ AP invoice creation
- frontend/src/app/ap/invoices/[id]/edit/page.tsx ✅ AP invoice editing

// API wrapper:
- frontend/src/services/api.ts → taxRatesAPI.list(country) ✅ Used
```

**What Users See:**
1. Tax rate dropdown in each invoice line item
2. **Smart filtering by country:**
   - When you select a customer, their country is used
   - Tax rates automatically filtered to that country
   - Example: Select UAE customer → only UAE VAT rates shown

**Example Code:**
```typescript
// When customer changes, reload tax rates for their country
const handleCustomerChange = async (customerId: string) => {
  const customer = customers.find(c => c.id === parseInt(customerId));
  if (customer && customer.country) {
    setFormData(prev => ({ 
      ...prev, 
      customer: customerId, 
      country: customer.country 
    }));
  }
};

// Auto-reload tax rates when country changes
useEffect(() => {
  if (formData.country) {
    fetchTaxRates(formData.country);
  }
}, [formData.country]);

// Fetch filtered tax rates
const fetchTaxRates = async (country?: string) => {
  const response = await taxRatesAPI.list(country);
  console.log(`Found ${response.data.length} tax rates for ${country}`);
  setTaxRates(response.data);
};
```

**Example User Experience:**
```
1. Create new AR Invoice
2. Select Customer: "ABC Company" (Country: UAE)
3. System auto-sets country = "AE"
4. Add line item: "Consulting Services"
5. Tax Rate dropdown shows:
   - UAE VAT Standard (5%)
   - UAE Zero-Rated (0%)
   - UAE Exempt (0%)
6. Select "UAE VAT Standard (5%)"
7. Tax calculated automatically: 1000 × 5% = 50
8. Total: 1,050
```

**What's MISSING:**
- ❌ No `/tax-rates` page to view all tax rates
- ❌ No "Add New Tax Rate" button
- ❌ No edit/delete tax rate functionality
- ❌ No "Seed Presets" button to auto-populate common rates
- ❌ Cannot manage effective dates (when rate starts/ends)
- ❌ Must manage tax rates via Django admin or API

## ❌ What is NOT Implemented

### 3. Exchange Rate Management (Complete Gap)

**Backend API (EXISTS but NOT USED):**
```
GET /api/fx/rates/                    - List exchange rates
POST /api/fx/rates/                   - Create exchange rate
GET /api/fx/rates/{id}/               - Get specific rate
PATCH /api/fx/rates/{id}/             - Update rate
DELETE /api/fx/rates/{id}/            - Delete rate
POST /api/fx/convert/                 - Convert amount between currencies
POST /api/fx/create-rate/             - Simplified rate creation
GET /api/fx/accounts/                 - FX gain/loss accounts
GET /api/fx/base-currency/            - Get base currency
```

**Frontend Usage:**
- ❌ NO files use these endpoints
- ❌ NO exchange rate pages
- ❌ NO currency converter
- ❌ NO FX gain/loss tracking

**What's MISSING:**
```
❌ No /fx/rates page
❌ No "Add Exchange Rate" form
❌ No rate history view
❌ No currency converter tool
❌ Invoices don't convert to base currency
❌ No FX gain/loss calculation on payments
❌ No period-end revaluation
```

**Impact:**
- If you invoice customer in USD but your base currency is AED:
  - Invoice stores: $1,000
  - Backend CAN convert using rates (if rates exist)
  - Frontend DOESN'T trigger conversion
  - Payment DOESN'T calculate FX gain/loss
  - No automatic journal entries for currency differences

**Example of What COULD Work (but doesn't in frontend):**
```
// This backend API exists but frontend never calls it:
POST /api/fx/convert/
{
  "amount": 1000,
  "from_currency_code": "USD",
  "to_currency_code": "AED",
  "rate_date": "2025-10-14"
}

Response:
{
  "from_currency": "USD",
  "to_currency": "AED",
  "original_amount": 1000.00,
  "exchange_rate": 3.6725,
  "converted_amount": 3672.50
}
```

### 4. Corporate Tax Management (Complete Gap)

**Backend API (EXISTS but NOT USED):**
```
POST /api/tax/corporate-accrual/        - Calculate and accrue tax
GET /api/tax/corporate-filing/{id}/     - Get filing details
POST /api/tax/corporate-file/{id}/      - Mark as filed
POST /api/tax/corporate-reverse/{id}/   - Reverse accrual
GET /api/tax/corporate-breakdown/       - Tax breakdown report
```

**Frontend Usage:**
- ❌ NO files use these endpoints
- ❌ NO corporate tax pages
- ❌ NO tax filing workflow

**What's MISSING:**
```
❌ No /tax/corporate page
❌ No "Accrue Tax" button
❌ No tax period selector
❌ No filing status view
❌ No tax calculation breakdown
❌ No file/reverse actions
```

**Impact:**
- Corporate income tax (UAE 9%, KSA 20%, etc.) is NOT managed
- Backend CAN calculate tax from journal entries
- Backend CAN create tax accrual journal entries
- Frontend has NO way to trigger this
- Must use Django admin or API directly

**Example of What COULD Work (but doesn't in frontend):**
```
// This backend API exists but frontend never calls it:
POST /api/tax/corporate-accrual/
{
  "country": "AE",
  "date_from": "2025-01-01",
  "date_to": "2025-03-31"
}

Response:
{
  "created": true,
  "filing_id": 5,
  "journal": {
    "id": 128,
    "date": "2025-03-31",
    "memo": "Corporate tax accrual AE Q1 2025 on profit 400000",
    "lines": [
      {"account": "6500", "debit": "2250.00", "credit": "0.00"},  // Tax Expense
      {"account": "2500", "debit": "0.00", "credit": "2250.00"}   // Tax Payable
    ]
  },
  "meta": {
    "profit": 400000.0,
    "tax_base": 25000.0,
    "tax": 2250.0
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Current Workarounds

### To Add a New Currency:
**Option 1: Django Admin**
1. Login to http://localhost:8000/admin/
2. Go to Core → Currencies
3. Click "Add Currency"
4. Enter code (USD), name (US Dollar), symbol ($)
5. Save

**Option 2: API Direct**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/currencies/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"code":"EUR","name":"Euro","symbol":"€"}'
```

### To Add a New Tax Rate:
**Option 1: Django Admin**
1. Login to http://localhost:8000/admin/
2. Go to Core → Tax Rates
3. Click "Add Tax Rate"
4. Enter details (country, rate, category, etc.)
5. Save

**Option 2: Seed Presets API**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/tax/seed-presets/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"effective_from":"2025-01-01"}'
```

This creates common rates for UAE (5%), Saudi (15%), Egypt (14%), India (18%)

### To Add Exchange Rates:
**Must use API (no frontend at all):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/fx/create-rate/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from_currency_code": "USD",
    "to_currency_code": "AED",
    "rate": "3.6725",
    "rate_date": "2025-10-14",
    "rate_type": "SPOT"
  }'
```

### To Accrue Corporate Tax:
**Must use API (no frontend at all):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/tax/corporate-accrual/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "country": "AE",
    "date_from": "2025-01-01",
    "date_to": "2025-03-31"
  }'
```
