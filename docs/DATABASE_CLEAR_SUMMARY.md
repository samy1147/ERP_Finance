# Database Clear Operation - Summary

## Date: October 16, 2025

## Operation
Deleted all data records from the FinanceERP database while preserving the database structure (tables, columns, relationships).

## Command Created
**File**: `core/management/commands/clear_all_data.py`

**Usage**:
```bash
# Preview warning (safe, doesn't delete)
python manage.py clear_all_data

# Actually delete all data (requires confirmation)
python manage.py clear_all_data --confirm
```

## Approach
Used raw SQL DELETE statements to bypass:
- Django ORM cascade deletion issues
- Simple History tracking (historical tables)
- Protected foreign key constraints
- Self-referencing foreign keys

## Technical Details

### Method
1. Disabled foreign key constraints temporarily (`PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF`)
2. Retrieved all non-system tables from `sqlite_master`
3. Executed `DELETE FROM table_name` for each table
4. Reset auto-increment counters in `sqlite_sequence`
5. Re-enabled foreign key constraints

### Tables Excluded
- `sqlite_%` - SQLite internal tables
- `django_%` - Django migrations and admin tables
- `auth_%` - Django authentication tables (users, permissions, groups)
- `simple_history_%` - Historical record tables (handled separately)

## Records Deleted

### Total Deleted
**348 records** across all tables

## Verification

After deletion, confirmed all transaction tables are empty:
```
AR Invoices: 0
AR Payments: 0
AP Invoices: 0
AP Payments: 0
Journal Entries: 0
Invoice Approvals: 0
```

## Database State

### Preserved
‚úÖ All table structures
‚úÖ All column definitions
‚úÖ All indexes
‚úÖ All foreign key relationships
‚úÖ All migrations history
‚úÖ All user accounts and permissions
‚úÖ Django admin configuration

### Removed
‚ùå All invoice records (AR & AP)
‚ùå All payment records (AR & AP)
‚ùå All journal entries and lines
‚ùå All approval workflows
‚ùå All master data (customers, suppliers)
‚ùå All configuration data (currencies, tax rates, exchange rates)
‚ùå All historical tracking records

## Result
Database is now **completely clean** with no business data, ready for:
- Fresh data entry
- Testing
- New implementation
- Data import

## Safety Features

### Confirmation Required
The command requires `--confirm` flag to execute, preventing accidental data loss.

### Preview Mode
Running without `--confirm` shows a warning message without deleting anything.

### System Tables Protected
Django system tables (migrations, auth, admin) are automatically excluded.

### Historical Records Included
Simple History tables are also cleared to ensure complete cleanup.

## Usage Examples

### Safe Preview
```bash
python manage.py clear_all_data
# Shows warning, doesn't delete
```

### Full Deletion
```bash
python manage.py clear_all_data --confirm
# Deletes all data with confirmation
```

### Verification
```bash
# Check if database is empty
python manage.py shell -c "
from ar.models import ARInvoice
from ap.models import APInvoice
print('AR Invoices:', ARInvoice.objects.count())
print('AP Invoices:', APInvoice.objects.count())
"
```

## Next Steps

To repopulate the database:
1. **Load initial data**: Run fixtures or management commands for currencies, tax rates, etc.
2. **Create master data**: Add customers, suppliers, accounts, bank accounts
3. **Create transactions**: Add invoices, payments, journal entries
4. **Test workflows**: Verify posting, approvals, allocations work correctly
