## Key Exchange Rates Explained

### Pegged Currencies
1. **USD/AED = 3.6725** (Fixed)
   - The UAE Dirham is officially pegged to the US Dollar
   - This rate is fixed by the UAE Central Bank
   - 1 USD = 3.6725 AED (approximately)

2. **USD/SAR = 3.75** (Fixed)
   - The Saudi Riyal is pegged to the US Dollar
   - 1 USD = 3.75 SAR (fixed rate)

### Floating Currencies
3. **EUR/USD ≈ 1.09**
   - Euro is stronger than USD in this example
   - 1 EUR = approximately 1.09 USD

4. **USD/INR ≈ 83.10**
   - Indian Rupee rate against USD
   - 1 USD = approximately 83.10 INR

5. **USD/EGP ≈ 49.10**
   - Egyptian Pound rate against USD
   - 1 USD = approximately 49.10 EGP

## How Exchange Rates Work in the System

### Example 1: Invoice in USD, Company in AED
```
Invoice Amount: 1,000 USD
Exchange Rate: 1 USD = 3.6725 AED
Converted Amount: 1,000 × 3.6725 = 3,672.50 AED
```

### Example 2: Invoice in EUR, Company in AED
```
Invoice Amount: 1,000 EUR
Exchange Rate: 1 EUR = 4.0125 AED
Converted Amount: 1,000 × 4.0125 = 4,012.50 AED
```

### Example 3: Cross Currency (EUR to USD)
```
Amount: 1,000 EUR
Cross Rate: 1 EUR = 1.092506 USD
Converted Amount: 1,000 × 1.092506 = 1,092.51 USD
```

## Database Schema

### ExchangeRate Model Fields
- `from_currency`: The currency being converted FROM
- `to_currency`: The currency being converted TO
- `rate_date`: The date this rate is effective
- `rate`: The exchange rate (1 from_currency = rate × to_currency)
- `rate_type`: Type of rate (SPOT, AVERAGE, FIXED, CLOSING)
- `source`: Source of the rate (e.g., "Initial Load", "Central Bank")
- `is_active`: Whether this rate is currently active
- `created_at`: Timestamp when rate was created
- `updated_at`: Timestamp when rate was last updated

### Unique Constraint
Each combination of `from_currency`, `to_currency`, `rate_date`, and `rate_type` must be unique.

## Usage in Invoices

### Creating Invoice in Foreign Currency
```python
from ar.models import ARInvoice
from core.models import Currency

# Create invoice in USD
usd = Currency.objects.get(code='USD')
invoice = ARInvoice.objects.create(
    customer=customer,
    number="INV-001",
    currency=usd,  # Invoice in USD
    date=date.today(),
    # ... other fields
)

# System will automatically use exchange rate for conversion to base currency (AED)
```

### Viewing Exchange Rates
```bash
# View all rates
python manage.py shell -c "
from core.models import ExchangeRate
for rate in ExchangeRate.objects.all():
    print(f'{rate.from_currency.code}/{rate.to_currency.code} = {rate.rate}')
"

# View rates for specific date
python manage.py shell -c "
from core.models import ExchangeRate
from datetime import date
rates = ExchangeRate.objects.filter(rate_date=date.today())
for rate in rates:
    print(f'{rate.from_currency.code}/{rate.to_currency.code} = {rate.rate}')
"
```

## Updating Exchange Rates

### Adding New Rates for Different Date
```bash
# Load rates for a specific date
python manage.py load_exchange_rates --date 2025-10-20
```

### Manual Update via Django Shell
```python
from core.models import ExchangeRate, Currency
from datetime import date
from decimal import Decimal

usd = Currency.objects.get(code='USD')
aed = Currency.objects.get(code='AED')

# Update existing rate or create new one
rate, created = ExchangeRate.objects.update_or_create(
    from_currency=usd,
    to_currency=aed,
    rate_date=date.today(),
    defaults={
        'rate': Decimal('3.6725'),
        'rate_type': 'SPOT',
        'source': 'Manual Entry',
        'is_active': True
    }
)
```

## Verification Queries

### Check All Rates to AED (Base Currency)
```bash
python manage.py shell -c "
from core.models import ExchangeRate, Currency
aed = Currency.objects.get(code='AED')
rates = ExchangeRate.objects.filter(to_currency=aed)
print('All rates to AED:')
for rate in rates:
    print(f'  1 {rate.from_currency.code} = {rate.rate} AED')
"
```

### Check Specific Currency Pair
```bash
python manage.py shell -c "
from core.models import ExchangeRate
rate = ExchangeRate.objects.get(
    from_currency__code='USD',
    to_currency__code='AED',
    rate_date='2025-10-16'
)
print(f'USD to AED: {rate.rate}')
"
```

### Count Total Rates
```bash
python manage.py shell -c "
from core.models import ExchangeRate
print(f'Total exchange rates: {ExchangeRate.objects.count()}')
"
```

## Rate Type Explanations

| Rate Type | Description | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **SPOT** | Current market rate | Daily transactions, real-time conversions |
| **AVERAGE** | Average rate over period | Month-end reporting, budget rates |
| **FIXED** | Fixed rate (pegged currencies) | USD/AED, USD/SAR |
| **CLOSING** | Period-end closing rate | Financial statement revaluation |

## Important Notes

### Bi-directional Rates
The system stores both directions:
- USD → AED (for converting USD invoices to AED)
- AED → USD (for converting AED invoices to USD)

This avoids calculation errors and improves performance.

### Rate Date
All rates are date-specific. The system will use the rate for the invoice date or the closest previous date if exact match not found.

### Historical Rates
Old rates are preserved in the system. You can query historical rates for any date:
```python
ExchangeRate.objects.filter(
    from_currency__code='USD',
    to_currency__code='AED',
    rate_date__lte=some_date
).order_by('-rate_date').first()
```

## Running the Command Again

The command is idempotent. Running it again for the same date will UPDATE existing rates:

```bash
python manage.py load_exchange_rates --date 2025-10-16
```

Output:
```
  ↻ Updated: USD/AED = 3.672500
  ↻ Updated: EUR/AED = 4.012500
  # ... etc
```

## Next Steps

1. **Set up FX Gain/Loss Accounts**: Configure GL accounts for foreign exchange gains and losses
2. **Test Multi-Currency Invoices**: Create invoices in different currencies
3. **Verify Currency Conversion**: Check that amounts convert correctly
4. **Update Rates Regularly**: Set up process to update exchange rates (daily/weekly)
5. **Historical Rate Management**: Consider setting up automated rate imports from central bank APIs
