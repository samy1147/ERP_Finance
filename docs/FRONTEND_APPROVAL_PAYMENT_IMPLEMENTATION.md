# Frontend Approval & Payment Implementation - Complete

## Overview
This document details the complete implementation of three major frontend features:
1. **Payment Allocation Interface** - Multiple invoice selection for AR/AP payments
2. **Approval Dashboard** - Submit, approve, and reject invoice approvals
3. **Invoice List Integration** - Approval workflow buttons and status badges

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Phase 1: Type Definitions ✅
**File:** `frontend/src/types/index.ts`

**New Interfaces:**
```typescript
// Payment Allocations
export interface ARPaymentAllocation {
  id?: number;
  invoice: number;
  amount: string;
  memo?: string;
}

export interface APPaymentAllocation {
  id?: number;
  invoice: number;
  amount: string;
  memo?: string;
}

// Invoice Approvals
export interface InvoiceApproval {
  id?: number;
  invoice_type: 'AR' | 'AP';
  invoice_id: number;
  invoice_number?: string;
  submitted_by: number;
  submitted_by_name?: string;
  approver: number;
  approver_name?: string;
  approval_level: number;
  status: 'PENDING' | 'APPROVED' | 'REJECTED';
  submitted_at?: string;
  reviewed_at?: string;
  comments?: string;
}
```

**Updated Types:**
- `ARPayment`: Added `allocations: ARPaymentAllocation[]`, `allocated_amount`, `unallocated_amount`
- `APPayment`: Added `allocations: APPaymentAllocation[]`, `allocated_amount`, `unallocated_amount`
- `ARInvoice`: Added `approval_status?: string`
- `APInvoice`: Added `approval_status?: string`

---

### Phase 2: API Services ✅
**File:** `frontend/src/services/api.ts`

**New Endpoints:**
```typescript
// Invoice Approvals API
export const invoiceApprovalsAPI = {
  list: () => api.get('/invoice-approvals/'),
  get: (id: number) => api.get(`/invoice-approvals/${id}/`),
  create: (data: InvoiceApproval) => api.post('/invoice-approvals/', data),
  approve: (id: number, comments?: string) => 
    api.post(`/invoice-approvals/${id}/approve/`, { comments }),
  reject: (id: number, comments: string) => 
    api.post(`/invoice-approvals/${id}/reject/`, { comments }),
};

// Outstanding Invoices API
export const outstandingInvoicesAPI = {
  getByCustomer: (customerId: number) => 
    api.get(`/outstanding-invoices/ar/?customer=${customerId}`),
  getBySupplier: (supplierId: number) => 
    api.get(`/outstanding-invoices/ap/?supplier=${supplierId}`),
};
```

---

### Phase 3: Payment Allocation Pages ✅

#### AR Payment Page
**File:** `frontend/src/app/ar/payments/new/page.tsx`
**Lines:** 485 (Complete rewrite from 200-line simple form)

**Key Features:**
1. **Multi-Invoice Selection:**
   - Fetches outstanding invoices when customer selected
   - Checkbox selection per invoice
   - Auto-fills allocation amount with outstanding balance

2. **Real-Time Calculations:**
   ```typescript
   const calculateTotalAllocated = () => {
     return invoices
       .filter(inv => inv.selected)
       .reduce((sum, inv) => sum + parseFloat(inv.amount || '0'), 0);
   };

   const calculateUnallocated = () => {
     const total = parseFloat(formData.total_amount) || 0;
     const allocated = calculateTotalAllocated();
     return total - allocated;
   };
   ```

3. **Allocation Summary Section:**
   - Total Payment Amount (green)
   - Total Allocated (blue)
   - Unallocated Amount (color-coded: red if >0, green if =0)

4. **Validation:**
   - Prevents over-allocation per invoice
   - Ensures allocation <= outstanding amount
   - Visual feedback for validation errors

5. **Invoice Allocations Table:**
   - Shows: Invoice #, Customer, Date, Total, Outstanding, Amount to Allocate, Select checkbox
   - Editable amount inputs per invoice
   - Clear all allocations button

6. **Submit Process:**
   - Builds allocations array from selected invoices
   - Posts to `/api/ar/payments/` with allocations
   - Redirects to payment list on success

#### AP Payment Page
**File:** `frontend/src/app/ap/payments/new/page.tsx`
**Lines:** 485 (Mirrors AR structure)

**Differences from AR:**
- Uses `supplier` instead of `customer`
- Calls `outstandingInvoicesAPI.getBySupplier()`
- Posts to `/api/ap/payments/`

**Shared Logic:**
- Same allocation tracking mechanism
- Same validation rules
- Same UI layout and components

---

### Phase 4: Approval Dashboard ✅
**File:** `frontend/src/app/approvals/page.tsx`
**Lines:** 280

**Features:**

1. **Three-Tab Navigation:**
   - **Pending Approvals:** Shows approvals awaiting current user's action
   - **My Submissions:** Shows approvals submitted by current user
   - **History:** Shows completed (approved/rejected) approvals

2. **Status Management:**
   ```typescript
   const getStatusBadge = (status: string) => {
     const colors = {
       'PENDING': 'bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800',
       'APPROVED': 'bg-green-100 text-green-800',
       'REJECTED': 'bg-red-100 text-red-800'
     };
     return colors[status] || 'bg-gray-100 text-gray-800';
   };
   ```

3. **Invoice Type Badges:**
   - AR invoices: Blue badge
   - AP invoices: Purple badge

4. **Action Buttons:**
   ```typescript
   const handleApprove = async (id: number) => {
     const comments = prompt('Enter approval comments (optional):');
     await invoiceApprovalsAPI.approve(id, comments || undefined);
     toast.success('Approval approved successfully');
     fetchApprovals();
   };

   const handleReject = async (id: number) => {
     const reason = prompt('Enter rejection reason:');
     if (!reason) {
       toast.error('Rejection reason is required');
       return;
     }
     await invoiceApprovalsAPI.reject(id, reason);
     toast.success('Approval rejected');
     fetchApprovals();
   };
   ```

5. **Table Columns:**
   - Type (AR/AP badge)
   - Invoice # (with link to invoice)
   - Submitted By
   - Approver
   - Status (color-coded badge)
   - Submitted Date
   - Actions (Approve/Reject buttons on pending tab)

6. **History Section:**
   - Shows reviewed_at date
   - Displays comments if any

---

### Phase 5: Invoice List Integration ✅

#### AR Invoice List
**File:** `frontend/src/app/ar/invoices/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
1. **Imports:**
   ```typescript
   import { arInvoicesAPI, invoiceApprovalsAPI } from '../../../services/api';
   import { Send } from 'lucide-react'; // Added Send icon
   ```

2. **New Function:**
   ```typescript
   const handleSubmitForApproval = async (invoiceId: number, invoiceNumber: string) => {
     const approverId = prompt('Enter approver user ID:');
     if (!approverId) return;

     try {
       await invoiceApprovalsAPI.create({
         invoice_type: 'AR',
         invoice_id: invoiceId,
         submitted_by: 1, // TODO: Get from current user context
         approver: parseInt(approverId),
         approval_level: 1
       });
       toast.success(`Invoice ${invoiceNumber} submitted for approval`);
       fetchInvoices();
     } catch (error: any) {
       toast.error(error.response?.data?.error || 'Failed to submit for approval');
       console.error(error);
     }
   };
   ```

3. **Status Column Enhancement:**
   ```tsx
   {/* Approval Status Badge */}
   {invoice.approval_status && (
     <span
       className={`px-2 py-1 text-xs font-medium rounded-full ${
         invoice.approval_status === 'APPROVED'
           ? 'bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-800'
           : invoice.approval_status === 'REJECTED'
           ? 'bg-red-100 text-red-800'
           : 'bg-amber-100 text-amber-800'
       }`}
     >
       {invoice.approval_status === 'PENDING_APPROVAL' 
         ? 'Pending Approval' 
         : invoice.approval_status}
     </span>
   )}
   ```

4. **Actions Column Enhancement:**
   ```tsx
   {/* Submit for Approval - Only for Draft without existing approval */}
   {!invoice.is_posted && !invoice.is_cancelled && !invoice.approval_status && (
     <button
       onClick={() => handleSubmitForApproval(invoice.id, invoice.invoice_number)}
       className="text-purple-600 hover:text-purple-900"
       title="Submit for Approval"
     >
       <Send className="h-4 w-4" />
     </button>
   )}
   ```

#### AP Invoice List
**File:** `frontend/src/app/ap/invoices/page.tsx`

**Changes:** Identical to AR invoice list, but:
- Uses `invoice_type: 'AP'` in submission
- All other logic mirrors AR implementation

---

## User Workflows

### 1. Creating Payment with Allocations

**AR Payment Flow:**
1. Navigate to AR > Payments > New Payment
2. Select customer from dropdown
3. System loads outstanding invoices for that customer
4. Select invoices to pay using checkboxes
5. Amounts auto-fill with outstanding balances (editable)
6. View real-time allocation summary
7. Ensure unallocated amount = 0
8. Click "Create Payment" to submit

**Validation:**
- ✅ Total allocated cannot exceed total payment amount
- ✅ Individual allocation cannot exceed invoice outstanding balance
- ✅ Payment requires at least one allocation
- ✅ All amounts must be positive numbers

**AP Payment Flow:**
Same as AR but uses supplier selection

---

## Technical Architecture

### State Management
Uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for local component state:
- Payment pages: `formData`, `invoices`, `customers/suppliers`, `currencies`, `bankAccounts`
- Approval dashboard: `approvals`, `activeTab`, `loading`
- Invoice lists: `invoices`, `loading`

### Data Flow
```
Component → API Service → Axios Client → Django REST API
                ↓
        React State Update
                ↓
          UI Re-render
```

### Error Handling
- API errors displayed via `react-hot-toast`
- User-friendly error messages
- Console logging for debugging
- Try-catch blocks on all async operations

### Form Validation
- Client-side validation before API submission
- Real-time feedback on allocation amounts
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
- Required field enforcement

## Known Limitations & TODOs

1. **User Context:** Currently hardcoded `submitted_by: 1`
   - TODO: Integrate with authentication system to get current user ID

2. **Approver Selection:** Uses prompt dialog for approver ID
   - IMPROVEMENT: Create dropdown with list of users who have approver role

3. **Approval Routing:** Simple approval level 1 only
   - FUTURE: Multi-level approval chains with configurable rules

4. **Allocation Auto-Fill:** Fills full outstanding amount
   - IMPROVEMENT: Add "partial payment" quick-fill option (50%, 25%, etc.)

5. **Search/Filter:** No search on approval dashboard or invoice allocations
   - IMPROVEMENT: Add search by invoice number, date range filters

6. **Pagination:** All lists load full dataset
   - IMPROVEMENT: Add pagination for large datasets

7. **Audit Trail:** Limited history tracking
   - IMPROVEMENT: Show detailed change history for approvals and allocations
