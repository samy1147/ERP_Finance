# Frontend Tax Calculation Update - Complete

## ✅ Changes Applied

Successfully updated the frontend invoice forms to calculate and display tax **BEFORE** showing the total, matching the backend logic.

### Files Modified
1. ✅ `frontend/src/app/ar/invoices/new/page.tsx` - AR Invoice Creation Form
2. ✅ `frontend/src/app/ap/invoices/new/page.tsx` - AP Invoice Creation Form

## What Was Changed

### 1. Added Tax Calculation Functions

**Before:** Only calculated subtotal (qty × price)

**After:** Now calculates:
- Line item subtotal
- Line item tax (based on selected tax rate)
- Line item total (subtotal + tax)
- Invoice totals (sum of all line items)

```typescript
// Calculate line item with tax
const calculateLineTotal = (item) => {
  const qty = parseFloat(item.quantity || '0');
  const price = parseFloat(item.unit_price || '0');
  const subtotal = qty * price;
  
  // Find and apply tax rate
  let taxRate = 0;
  if (item.tax_rate) {
    const selectedTaxRate = taxRates.find(tr => tr.id === parseInt(item.tax_rate));
    if (selectedTaxRate) {
      taxRate = parseFloat(selectedTaxRate.rate);
    }
  }
  
  const tax = subtotal * (taxRate / 100);
  return {
    subtotal,
    tax,
    total: subtotal + tax  // Tax applied FIRST
  };
};

// Calculate invoice totals
const calculateTotals = () => {
  let subtotal = 0;
  let tax = 0;
  
  items.forEach(item => {
    const lineCalc = calculateLineTotal(item);
    subtotal += lineCalc.subtotal;
    tax += lineCalc.tax;
  });
  
  return {
    subtotal: subtotal,
    tax: tax,
    total: subtotal + tax  // Invoice currency total
  };
};
```

### 2. Updated Line Item Display

**Before:** Showed only subtotal per line
```tsx
<span>$100.00</span>
```

**After:** Shows total with tax, plus tax breakdown
```tsx
<div className="flex flex-col">
  <span>USD 105.00</span>  {/* Total with tax */}
  {tax > 0 && (
    <span>(Tax: 5.00)</span>  {/* Tax amount */}
  )}
</div>
```

### 3. Updated Invoice Total Section

**Before:** Single total line
```tsx
<div>Total</div>
<div>$1,000.00</div>  {/* Wrong - no tax! */}
```

**After:** Complete breakdown with currency code
```tsx
<div>
  <div>Subtotal: USD 1,000.00</div>
  <div>Tax:      USD    50.00</div>
  <div>Total:    USD 1,050.00</div>
  <div>Tax calculated in invoice currency</div>
</div>
```

## UI Changes

### Invoice Creation Form - Before vs After

#### BEFORE ❌
```
Line Items:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Description | Qty | Price | Tax Rate | Amt │
│ Product A   | 10  | 100   | 5%       | 100 │ ← WRONG!
│ Product B   | 5   | 200   | 5%       | 200 │ ← WRONG!
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Total: $1,300  ← NO TAX CALCULATED!
```

#### AFTER ✅
```
Line Items:
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Description | Qty | Price | Tax Rate | Amount     │
│ Product A   | 10  | 100   | 5%       | USD 1,050  │ ✓
│                                       (Tax: 50)    │
│ Product B   | 5   | 200   | 5%       | USD 1,050  │ ✓
│                                       (Tax: 50)    │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Subtotal: USD 1,300.00
Tax:      USD   130.00  ← TAX SHOWN!
─────────────────────────
Total:    USD 1,430.00  ← CORRECT TOTAL!
Tax calculated in invoice currency
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: USD Invoice with 5% UAE VAT

**Input:**
- Currency: USD
- Country: AE (UAE)
- Tax Rate: 5% (UAE VAT Standard)
- Line 1: 10 × $100 = $1,000

**Display:**
```
Line Items:
  Item 1: USD 1,050.00
          (Tax: 50.00)

Invoice Totals:
  Subtotal: USD 1,000.00
  Tax:      USD    50.00
  ─────────────────────────
  Total:    USD 1,050.00

Tax calculated in invoice currency
```

**When Posted to GL:**
```
Backend converts USD 1,050 → Base currency (e.g., AED)
Tax was calculated FIRST in USD, then converted
```

### Scenario 2: Mixed Tax Rates

**Input:**
- Currency: AED
- Country: AE
- Line 1: 10 × AED 100 @ 5% = AED 1,050
- Line 2: 5 × AED 200 @ 0% = AED 1,000 (zero-rated)

**Display:**
```
Line Items:
  Item 1: AED 1,050.00
          (Tax: 50.00)
  Item 2: AED 1,000.00
          (no tax indicator)

Invoice Totals:
  Subtotal: AED 2,100.00
  Tax:      AED    50.00
  ─────────────────────────
  Total:    AED 2,150.00
```

### Scenario 3: No Tax Selected

**Input:**
- Line 1: 10 × $100, no tax rate

**Display:**
```
Line Items:
  Item 1: USD 1,000.00
          (no tax indicator)

Invoice Totals:
  Subtotal: USD 1,000.00
  Tax:      USD     0.00
  ─────────────────────────
  Total:    USD 1,000.00
```

## Technical Details

### Tax Calculation Flow

```
User Input → Line Items with Tax Rates
                    ↓
         Calculate Per Line (in invoice currency)
         - Subtotal = Qty × Price
         - Tax = Subtotal × (Rate / 100)
         - Line Total = Subtotal + Tax
                    ↓
         Sum All Lines
         - Invoice Subtotal
         - Invoice Tax
         - Invoice Total (with tax)
                    ↓
         Display in Invoice Currency
         (Backend will convert to base currency)
```

### Currency Display

- Shows currency code from selected currency
- Format: `{CODE} {AMOUNT}`
- Examples:
  - USD 1,050.00
  - AED 3,853.50
  - SAR 1,150.00
  - EGP 16,500.00

### Tax Rate Lookup

When user selects a tax rate:
```typescript
const selectedTaxRate = taxRates.find(tr => tr.id === item.tax_rate);
const rate = selectedTaxRate.rate;  // e.g., 5
const tax = subtotal * (rate / 100);  // 1000 × (5 / 100) = 50
```

4. **View Invoice Total** → See breakdown:
   - Subtotal (before tax)
   - Tax amount
   - Total (with tax)
5. **Submit Invoice** → Backend receives correct amounts

### Clear Indicators

✓ **Tax badge in dropdown:** "UAE VAT Standard (5%)"  
✓ **Line amount shows tax:** "USD 105.00 (Tax: 5.00)"  
✓ **Total breakdown:** Subtotal + Tax = Total  
✓ **Currency code:** Shows invoice currency  
✓ **Note:** "Tax calculated in invoice currency"  

## Consistency with Backend

### Frontend (Display)
```typescript
// Calculate in invoice currency
subtotal = qty × price
tax = subtotal × (rate / 100)
total = subtotal + tax

// Display: USD 1,050.00
```

### Backend (Posting)
```python
# Calculate in invoice currency
subtotal = qty * price
tax = subtotal * (rate / 100)
invoice_total = subtotal + tax

# Then convert to base currency
total_base = convert_amount(invoice_total, inv.currency, base_currency)
```

**Result:** Frontend and backend calculate tax the same way! ✅

## Common Issues Prevented

**After:** Shows USD, AED, SAR, etc. ✅

### ❌ Issue: No Tax Breakdown
