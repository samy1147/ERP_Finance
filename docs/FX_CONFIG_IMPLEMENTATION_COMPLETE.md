## 🎯 Key Functionality Explained

### **What Is Base Currency?**
The base currency (also called "functional currency" or "home currency") is:
- Your company's primary operating currency
- The currency used for financial statements
- The target for all foreign currency conversions

**Example:** If your base currency is AED:
- All reports show amounts in AED
- Foreign invoices (USD, EUR, etc.) are converted to AED
- P&L and Balance Sheet prepared in AED

### **What Are FX Gain/Loss Accounts?**

When you do business in multiple currencies, exchange rate changes create gains or losses:

**Realized = Settled Transactions**
- You invoice $100 USD when rate is 3.67 AED = 367 AED
- Customer pays $100 USD when rate is 3.73 AED = 373 AED
- You received 6 AED more than expected = **Realized Gain of 6 AED**

**Unrealized = Outstanding Balances**
- Month-end: You have $1,000 USD outstanding receivable
- Original rate: 3.67 AED = 3,670 AED booked
- Current rate: 3.73 AED = 3,730 AED current value
- Potential gain of 60 AED (not received yet) = **Unrealized Gain of 60 AED**

### **Why 4 Separate Accounts?**

1. **Realized Gain** (Income)
   - Money you actually gained from FX
   - Taxable in most jurisdictions

2. **Realized Loss** (Expense)
   - Money you actually lost from FX
   - Tax deductible in most jurisdictions

3. **Unrealized Gain** (Income)
   - Potential gains (period-end revaluation)
   - May not be taxable (depends on jurisdiction)

4. **Unrealized Loss** (Expense)
   - Potential losses (period-end revaluation)
   - May not be deductible (depends on jurisdiction)

**Accounting Standard:** IAS 21 (International Accounting Standard for foreign currency)

## 🚀 How to Use (Quick Start)

### First-Time Setup:

1. **Navigate to `/fx/config`** (click "FX Configuration" on dashboard)

2. **Set Base Currency:**
   ```
   If no base currency is set, you'll see a red warning box.
   Click on your currency (e.g., "AED" for UAE companies)
   Confirm the selection.
   ```

3. **Configure FX Accounts (Do all 4):**
   ```
   Click "+ Configure Account"
   
   For each type:
   1. Select "Realized FX Gain"
   2. Select GL Account "8010 - Foreign Exchange Gain"
   3. Add description: "Auto-posted from payment settlements"
   4. Click "Create"
   
   Repeat for:
   - Realized FX Loss → Account 9010
   - Unrealized FX Gain → Account 8020
   - Unrealized FX Loss → Account 9020
   ```

4. **Verify Configuration:**
   ```
   All 4 cards should show green borders
   Warning banner should disappear
   Each card shows the configured account
   ```

5. **Done!**
   ```
   Your system is now ready for multi-currency transactions!
