## üîß IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Step 1: Run Migrations (REQUIRED)

```bash
# Generate migrations
python manage.py makemigrations ar
python manage.py makemigrations ap
python manage.py makemigrations finance

# Review the migration files (IMPORTANT!)
# Check: ar/migrations/, ap/migrations/, finance/migrations/

# Apply migrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### Step 2: Migrate Existing Data (If you have data)

```bash
# Test first with dry-run
python manage.py migrate_payments --dry-run

# Then apply
python manage.py migrate_payments
```

### Step 3: Restart Django Server

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Start again
python manage.py runserver
```

### Step 4: Test APIs

Visit: http://localhost:8000/api/docs/

Look for new endpoints:
- `/api/ar/payments/` (Extended)
- `/api/ap/payments/` (Extended)
- `/api/bank-statements/`
- `/api/invoice-approvals/`
- `/api/outstanding-invoices/`

## üìä FEATURE DETAILS

### 1. PAYMENT ALLOCATIONS ‚úÖ

**What Changed:**
- AR/AP Payment models now support multiple invoice allocations
- One payment can be split across multiple invoices
- Partial payments fully supported
- Track allocated vs unallocated amounts

**Example:**
```json
POST /api/ar/payments/
{
  "customer": 1,
  "reference": "PMT-001",
  "total_amount": "10000.00",
  "currency": 1,
  "date": "2025-10-15",
  "allocations": [
    {"invoice": 10, "amount": "6000.00"},
    {"invoice": 11, "amount": "4000.00"}
  ]
}
```

**New APIs:**
- `POST /api/ar/payments/` - Create with allocations
- `GET /api/ar/payments/outstanding/` - List unallocated payments
- `GET /api/outstanding-invoices/?customer=1` - Get customer's outstanding invoices
- Same for AP payments

**Database:**
- New table: `ar_arpaymentallocation`
- New table: `ap_appaymentallocation`
- Modified: `ar_arpayment` (added customer, reference, total_amount, currency)
- Modified: `ap_appayment` (added supplier, reference, total_amount, currency)

---

### 2. INVOICE APPROVAL WORKFLOW ‚úÖ

**What Changed:**
- Added approval_status field to AR/AP invoices
- New approval tracking model
- Multi-level approval support
- Approval history with comments

**Workflow:**
```
DRAFT ‚Üí PENDING_APPROVAL ‚Üí APPROVED ‚Üí POSTED
                ‚Üì
            REJECTED ‚Üí DRAFT
```

**Example:**
```json
# Submit for approval
POST /api/invoice-approvals/
{
  "invoice_type": "AR",
  "invoice_id": 10,
  "submitted_by": "john@company.com",
  "approval_level": 1
}

# Approve
POST /api/invoice-approvals/{id}/approve/
{
  "approver": "manager@company.com",
  "comments": "Approved"
}

# Reject
POST /api/invoice-approvals/{id}/reject/
{
  "approver": "manager@company.com",
  "comments": "Missing line items"
}
```

**New APIs:**
- `POST /api/invoice-approvals/` - Submit for approval
- `POST /api/invoice-approvals/{id}/approve/` - Approve
- `POST /api/invoice-approvals/{id}/reject/` - Reject
- `GET /api/invoice-approvals/?status=PENDING_APPROVAL` - List pending

**Database:**
- New table: `finance_invoiceapproval`
- Modified: `ar_arinvoice` (added approval_status field)
- Modified: `ap_apinvoice` (added approval_status field)

**Business Rules:**
- Only DRAFT invoices can be submitted for approval
- Only APPROVED invoices can be posted to GL
- Rejected invoices return to DRAFT for editing
- Comments required when rejecting

---

### 4. INVOICE EDITING ‚úÖ (Backend Ready)

**What Changed:**
- Models support full editing of draft invoices
- Posted invoices remain locked
- API endpoints updated to handle edits

**Example:**
```json
PATCH /api/ar/invoices/{id}/
{
  "due_date": "2025-11-30",
  "country": "SA"
}

PUT /api/ar/invoices/{id}/
{
  "number": "INV-001",
  "customer": 1,
  "items": [
    {"description": "Updated item", "quantity": 15, "unit_price": "120.00"}
  ]
}
```

**Status:**
- ‚úÖ Backend models support editing
- ‚úÖ API endpoints working
- ‚è≥ Frontend edit pages NOT YET CREATED

**To Do:**
- Create `/ar/invoices/{id}/edit` page
- Create `/ap/invoices/{id}/edit` page
- Pre-fill forms with existing data
- Allow line item modifications

---

## üé® FRONTEND TODO

### Priority 1: Payment Pages (High)

**AR Payment Create** (`/ar/payments/new`)
- Customer selector
- Payment reference input
- Total amount
- **Allocation section:**
  - Show customer's outstanding invoices
  - Select invoices with checkboxes
  - Enter amount for each
  - Show unallocated balance
  - Validation (can't over-allocate)

**AP Payment Create** (similar)

### Priority 2: Approval Dashboard (Medium)

**Approvals Page** (`/approvals`)
- Tabs:
  - Pending Approvals (for me to approve)
  - My Submissions (invoices I submitted)
  - History (all approvals)
- Approve/Reject buttons
- Comments field
- Invoice preview

**Update Invoice Pages:**
- Add "Submit for Approval" button
- Show approval status badge
- Disable "Post to GL" if not approved

### Priority 3: Invoice Edit Pages (Low)

**Edit Pages** (`/ar/invoices/{id}/edit`, `/ap/invoices/{id}/edit`)
- Reuse create page layout
- Pre-fill with existing data
- Allow modifications
- Show "Cannot edit posted invoice" message
- Save changes

## üß™ TESTING GUIDE

### Test Payment Allocations

  "currency": 1,
  "date": "2025-10-15",
  "allocations": [
    {"invoice": 1, "amount": "3000.00"},

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES

### Before Migrating:

1. **Backup your database!**
   ```bash
   cp db.sqlite3 db.sqlite3.backup
   ```

2. **Review migration files** before applying
   - Check for data loss warnings
   - Ensure field types are correct

3. **Test on a copy first** if you have production data

### After Migrating:

1. **Run data migration script** for existing payments
2. **Test all existing functionality** to ensure nothing broke
3. **Test new APIs** with Postman/Swagger
4. **Start building frontend pages** one by one

### Backward Compatibility:

- Old payment structure kept for compatibility
- `invoice` and `amount` fields marked as deprecated
- Will work with both old and new code during transition
