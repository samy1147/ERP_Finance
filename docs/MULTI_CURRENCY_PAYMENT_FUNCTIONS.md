## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Currency Support

**Before (Old System):**
```python
# Only worked if payment and invoice in same currency
entry = JournalEntry.objects.create(currency=invoice.currency)
JournalLine.objects.create(account=bank, debit=payment.amount)
JournalLine.objects.create(account=ar, credit=payment.amount)
```

**Now (New System):**
```python
# Works with any currency combination
# All entries in BASE CURRENCY
entry = JournalEntry.objects.create(currency=base_currency)

# Convert payment to base currency
bank_amount_base = convert_amount(payment.amount, payment.currency, base_currency, date)

# Convert AR reduction to base currency  
ar_amount_base = convert_amount(invoice_amount, invoice.currency, base_currency, date)

# Calculate FX gain/loss automatically
fx_gain_loss = bank_amount_base - ar_amount_base
```

### 2. Multiple Invoice Allocations

**Payment can be split across multiple invoices:**

```python
# Example: One payment of USD 1,000 allocated to 3 invoices
payment = ARPayment(total_amount=1000, currency=USD)

allocations:
├─ Invoice A (EUR 300): Allocate USD 330
├─ Invoice B (EUR 200): Allocate USD 220  
└─ Invoice C (GBP 350): Allocate USD 450
```

**The function handles:**
- Each allocation can be in different currency
- Each has its own exchange rate
- FX gain/loss calculated per allocation
- Total FX impact summed in base currency

### 3. Automatic FX Gain/Loss

**Calculation Formula:**
```
FX Gain/Loss = (Payment Rate - Invoice Rate) × Amount in Invoice Currency

Example:
Invoice posted: 1 EUR = 4.00 AED (Jan 1)
Payment made: 1 EUR = 4.20 AED (Mar 1)
Invoice: EUR 10,000

AR booked at: 10,000 × 4.00 = 40,000 AED
Cash received: 10,000 × 4.20 = 42,000 AED
FX GAIN: 42,000 - 40,000 = 2,000 AED
```

**In Code:**
```python
invoice_rate = invoice.exchange_rate  # 4.00
payment_rate = payment.exchange_rate  # 4.20

amount_in_invoice_curr = allocation_amount / payment_rate
fx_impact = amount_in_invoice_curr * (payment_rate - invoice_rate)

# If positive = FX Gain
# If negative = FX Loss
```

## Function Signatures

### AR Payment Posting

```python
def post_ar_payment(payment: ARPayment) -> tuple:
    """
    Post AR payment to GL with multi-currency and FX gain/loss support.
    
    Args:
        payment: ARPayment instance with allocations
        
    Returns:
        (journal_entry, already_posted, invoice_closed_list)
        - journal_entry: JournalEntry created
        - already_posted: Always False (for compatibility)
        - invoice_closed_list: List of invoice numbers that are now fully paid
        
    Process:
        1. Update FX tracking fields if not set
        2. Create journal entry in base currency
        3. Process each allocation:
           - Convert amounts to base currency
           - Calculate FX gain/loss
        4. Post journal lines:
           - Debit: Bank (cash received)
           - Credit: AR (reduce receivable)
           - Credit/Debit: FX Gain/Loss account
        5. Update invoice payment status
    """
```

### AP Payment Posting

```python
def post_ap_payment(payment: APPayment) -> tuple:
    """
    Post AP payment to GL with multi-currency and FX gain/loss support.
    
    Args:
        payment: APPayment instance with allocations
        
    Returns:
        (journal_entry, already_posted, invoice_closed_list)
        - journal_entry: JournalEntry created
        - already_posted: Always False (for compatibility)
        - invoice_closed_list: List of invoice numbers that are now fully paid
        
    Process:
        1. Update FX tracking fields if not set
        2. Create journal entry in base currency
        3. Process each allocation:
           - Convert amounts to base currency
           - Calculate FX gain/loss
        4. Post journal lines:
           - Debit: AP (reduce liability)
           - Credit: Bank (reduce cash)
           - Credit/Debit: FX Gain/Loss account
        5. Update invoice payment status
    """
```

## Journal Entry Logic

### AR Payment Journal Entry

```
For AR Payment:
──────────────────────────────────────────
Dr: Bank                  42,000 AED     (cash received)
    Cr: AR                40,000 AED     (reduce receivable)
    Cr: FX Gain            2,000 AED     (exchange rate benefit)
──────────────────────────────────────────

Explanation:
- Customer owed EUR 10,000
- Booked as AED 40,000 (at rate 4.00)
- Paid AED 42,000 (at rate 4.20)
- Gain: AED 2,000
```

### AP Payment Journal Entry

```
For AP Payment:
──────────────────────────────────────────
Dr: AP                    40,000 AED     (reduce liability)
Dr: FX Loss                2,000 AED     (exchange rate cost)
    Cr: Bank              42,000 AED     (cash paid)
──────────────────────────────────────────

Explanation:
- Company owed EUR 10,000
- Booked as AED 40,000 (at rate 4.00)
- Paid AED 42,000 (at rate 4.20)
- Loss: AED 2,000
```

---

## Multi-Currency Flow

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Create Payment
```python
payment = ARPayment.objects.create(
    customer=customer,
    reference="PAY-001",
    date=date.today(),
    total_amount=42000.00,
    currency=aed_currency,  # Payment in AED
    bank_account=bank_account
)
```

#### 2. Create Allocations
```python
ARPaymentAllocation.objects.create(
    payment=payment,
    invoice=invoice,  # Invoice in EUR
    amount=42000.00,
    memo="Payment for Invoice INV-001"
)
```

#### 3. Update FX Tracking
```python
payment.update_exchange_rate_from_allocations()

# Result:
# payment.invoice_currency = EUR
# payment.exchange_rate = 4.012500
```

#### 4. Post to GL
```python
entry, already_posted, closed_invoices = post_ar_payment(payment)

# Result:
# - Journal entry created in base currency (AED)
# - FX gain/loss calculated and posted
# - Invoice payment status updated
# - payment.posted_at set
# - payment.gl_journal linked to entry
```

## FX Gain/Loss Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Currency Strengthens (FX Gain for AR)

```
Invoice:
- Date: Jan 1
- Amount: EUR 10,000
- Rate: 1 EUR = 4.00 AED
- Booked: 40,000 AED

Payment:
- Date: Mar 1
- Amount: 42,000 AED
- Rate: 1 EUR = 4.20 AED
- EUR equivalent: 10,000 EUR

## Code Examples

### Example 1: Simple Cross-Currency Payment

```python
from ar.models import ARPayment, ARPaymentAllocation
from finance.services import post_ar_payment

# Get invoice (in EUR)
invoice = ARInvoice.objects.get(number="INV-001")

# Create payment (in AED)
payment = ARPayment.objects.create(
    customer=invoice.customer,
    reference="PAY-2025-001",
    date=date.today(),
    total_amount=42000.00,
    currency=Currency.objects.get(code='AED'),
    bank_account=BankAccount.objects.first()
)

# Allocate to invoice
ARPaymentAllocation.objects.create(
    payment=payment,
    invoice=invoice,
    amount=42000.00
)

# Update FX tracking
payment.update_exchange_rate_from_allocations()

# Post to GL
entry, _, closed = post_ar_payment(payment)
print(f"Posted: {entry.id}")
print(f"Closed invoices: {closed}")
```

### Example 2: Multi-Invoice Allocation

```python
# Create one payment for multiple invoices
payment = ARPayment.objects.create(
    customer=customer,
    reference="PAY-2025-002",
    date=date.today(),
    total_amount=100000.00,
    currency=Currency.objects.get(code='AED')
)

# Allocate to multiple invoices
ARPaymentAllocation.objects.create(
    payment=payment,
    invoice=invoice1,  # EUR invoice
    amount=40000.00
)

ARPaymentAllocation.objects.create(
    payment=payment,
    invoice=invoice2,  # EUR invoice
    amount=35000.00
)

ARPaymentAllocation.objects.create(
    payment=payment,
    invoice=invoice3,  # EUR invoice
    amount=25000.00
)

# Update FX tracking (will check all invoices are same currency)
payment.update_exchange_rate_from_allocations()

# Post to GL
entry, _, closed = post_ar_payment(payment)
print(f"Paid {len(closed)} invoices: {closed}")
```

### Example 3: AP Payment with FX Loss

```python
from ap.models import APPayment, APPaymentAllocation
from finance.services import post_ap_payment

# Get invoice (in EUR)
invoice = APInvoice.objects.get(number="BILL-001")

# Create payment (in USD)
payment = APPayment.objects.create(
    supplier=invoice.supplier,
    reference="PAY-2025-003",
    date=date.today(),
    total_amount=1100.00,
    currency=Currency.objects.get(code='USD')
)

# Allocate to invoice
APPaymentAllocation.objects.create(
    payment=payment,
    invoice=invoice,
    amount=1100.00
)

# Update FX tracking
payment.update_exchange_rate_from_allocations()

# Post to GL
entry, _, closed = post_ap_payment(payment)

# Check for FX loss
for line in entry.lines.filter(account__code='9998'):  # FX Loss account
    print(f"FX Loss: {line.debit} {entry.currency.code}")
```

## Account Configuration

### Required Accounts

| Account Code | Account Name | Type | Purpose |
|--------------|--------------|------|---------|
| 1000 | Bank | Asset | Cash received/paid |
| 1100 | Accounts Receivable | Asset | Customer invoices |
| 2000 | Accounts Payable | Liability | Supplier invoices |
| 9999 | FX Gain | Income | Foreign exchange gains |
| 9998 | FX Loss | Expense | Foreign exchange losses |

### Setup

```python
from finance.models import Account

# FX Gain account
Account.objects.create(
    code='9999',
    name='Foreign Exchange Gain',
    type='income'
)

# FX Loss account
Account.objects.create(
    code='9998',
    name='Foreign Exchange Loss',
    type='expense'
)
```

---

## Error Handling

### Missing FX Accounts

```python
try:
    fx_gain_account = Account.objects.get(code='9999')
    fx_loss_account = Account.objects.get(code='9998')
    fx_accounts_available = True
except Account.DoesNotExist:
    fx_accounts_available = False
    print("Warning: FX Gain/Loss accounts not configured")
    # Payment still posts, but without FX gain/loss entries
```

### Missing Exchange Rate

```python
if not payment.exchange_rate and payment.allocations.exists():
    # Auto-update from allocations
    payment.update_exchange_rate_from_allocations()
    payment.refresh_from_db()

if not payment.exchange_rate:
    # Use rate of 1.0 as fallback
    payment_rate = Decimal('1.0')
```

### Mixed Currency Allocations

```python
# If allocations are in DIFFERENT currencies:
invoice_currencies = set(alloc.invoice.currency for alloc in allocations)

if len(invoice_currencies) > 1:
    # Cannot automatically determine single exchange rate
    # Each allocation uses its own currency
    # FX calculated per allocation
```

## Migration Guide

### From Old to New System

**Old Code:**
```python
# Single invoice only
payment = ARPayment.objects.create(
    invoice=invoice,
    amount=1000,
    date=date.today()
)
post_ar_payment(payment)
```

**New Code:**
```python
# Multi-invoice support
payment = ARPayment.objects.create(
    customer=customer,
    total_amount=1000,
    currency=currency,
    date=date.today()
)

ARPaymentAllocation.objects.create(
    payment=payment,
    invoice=invoice,
    amount=1000
)

payment.update_exchange_rate_from_allocations()
post_ar_payment(payment)
```

**Good News:** Old code still works! The functions support both systems.

---

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Tips

1. **Batch Updates**: Update FX tracking for multiple payments:
```python
for payment in ARPayment.objects.filter(exchange_rate__isnull=True):
    payment.update_exchange_rate_from_allocations()
```

2. **Eager Loading**: Load related objects:
```python
payments = ARPayment.objects.select_related(
    'currency', 'invoice_currency', 'customer'
).prefetch_related('allocations__invoice')
```

3. **Bulk Create Allocations**:
```python
allocations = [
    ARPaymentAllocation(payment=payment, invoice=inv, amount=amt)
    for inv, amt in invoice_amounts
]
ARPaymentAllocation.objects.bulk_create(allocations)
```

---

## Summary

✅ **Multi-Currency**: Full support for any currency combination  
✅ **FX Gain/Loss**: Automatic calculation and posting  
✅ **Multi-Allocation**: Split payments across multiple invoices  
✅ **Base Currency**: All journal entries in base currency  
✅ **Backward Compatible**: Works with old single-invoice system  
✅ **Tested**: Comprehensive test coverage  
✅ **Production Ready**: Error handling and logging  

**Status**: ✅ **Fully Implemented and Tested**  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-18
