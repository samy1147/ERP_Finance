# Payment FX Tracking for Gain/Loss Calculations

## Overview

Added **FX tracking fields** directly to the **Payment tables** (`ARPayment` and `APPayment`) to enable accurate **Foreign Exchange Gain/Loss** calculations when payment currency differs from invoice currency.

---

## Problem Statement

### The FX Challenge

When a customer pays in a different currency than the invoice:

```
SCENARIO:
1. Invoice created on Jan 1:
   - Amount: EUR 10,000
   - Posted at rate: 1 EUR = 4.00 AED
   - Booked value: 40,000 AED

2. Payment received on Mar 1:
   - Amount: 42,000 AED
   - Current rate: 1 EUR = 4.20 AED
   - Actual EUR value: 10,000 EUR

RESULT:
- Customer paid same EUR amount
- But in AED terms: 42,000 - 40,000 = 2,000 AED FX GAIN
```

### Solution

Store the **exchange rate at payment time** in the payment record to calculate FX gain/loss by comparing:
- **Invoice rate** (when invoice was posted)
- **Payment rate** (when payment was received)

---

## New Fields

### Added to Both `ARPayment` and `APPayment`:

#### 1. `invoice_currency` Field
```python
invoice_currency = models.ForeignKey(
    Currency, 
    on_delete=models.PROTECT, 
    null=True, 
    blank=True,
    related_name="ar_payments_invoice_currency",  # or ap_payments_invoice_currency
    help_text="Currency of the invoice(s) being paid - for FX tracking"
)
```

**Purpose**: Stores which currency the customer/supplier was originally invoiced in  
**Source**: Automatically populated from invoice allocations  
**Why**: Needed to identify cross-currency transactions

#### 2. `exchange_rate` Field
```python
exchange_rate = models.DecimalField(
    max_digits=18, 
    decimal_places=6, 
    null=True, 
    blank=True,
    help_text="Exchange rate from invoice currency to payment currency (for FX gain/loss)"
)
```

**Purpose**: Stores the exchange rate at payment time  
**Calculation**: FROM invoice currency TO payment currency  
**Source**: Fetched from exchange rate table using payment date  
**Why**: Enables FX gain/loss calculation

---

## How It Works

### Automatic Population

Call `update_exchange_rate_from_allocations()` method after creating payment allocations:

```python
# Create payment
payment = ARPayment.objects.create(
    customer=customer,
    total_amount=42000.00,
    currency=aed_currency,  # Payment in AED
    date=payment_date
)

# Create allocation
ARPaymentAllocation.objects.create(
    payment=payment,
    invoice=invoice,  # Invoice in EUR
    amount=42000.00
)

# Update FX fields from allocations
payment.update_exchange_rate_from_allocations()

# Result:
# payment.invoice_currency = EUR
# payment.exchange_rate = 4.012500 (1 EUR = 4.0125 AED at payment date)
```

### Method Logic

```python
def update_exchange_rate_from_allocations(self):
    """
    Update invoice_currency and exchange_rate based on allocated invoices.
    If all allocations are to invoices in the same currency (different from payment currency),
    fetch and store the exchange rate for FX gain/loss calculations.
    """
    allocations = self.allocations.all()
    if not allocations.exists():
        return
    
    # Get all unique invoice currencies from allocations
    invoice_currencies = set(
        alloc.invoice.currency for alloc in allocations if alloc.invoice
    )
    
    # If all invoices are in the same currency
    if len(invoice_currencies) == 1:
        inv_currency = invoice_currencies.pop()
        
        if self.currency and inv_currency.id != self.currency.id:
            # Different currencies - fetch exchange rate
            self.invoice_currency = inv_currency
            self.exchange_rate = get_exchange_rate(
                from_currency=inv_currency,
                to_currency=self.currency,
                rate_date=self.date,
                rate_type="SPOT"
            )
            self.save(update_fields=['invoice_currency', 'exchange_rate'])
```

**Key Points:**
- Only works when ALL allocations are in the SAME invoice currency
- Compares invoice currency vs payment currency
- Fetches exchange rate from rate table using payment date
- Stores rate for future FX gain/loss calculations

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Same Currency (No FX)
```
Invoice: EUR 1,000
Payment: EUR 1,000

Payment Record:
├─ currency: EUR
├─ invoice_currency: EUR
└─ exchange_rate: 1.000000

FX Gain/Loss: NONE (same currency)
```

### Use Case 2: Cross-Currency Payment
```
Invoice: EUR 10,000
Posted at: 1 EUR = 4.00 AED (Jan 1)
Booked value: 40,000 AED

Payment: 42,000 AED (Mar 1)
Current rate: 1 EUR = 4.20 AED

Payment Record:
├─ currency: AED
├─ invoice_currency: EUR
└─ exchange_rate: 4.200000

FX Gain/Loss Calculation:
- Original booking: 40,000 AED (at 4.00 rate)
- Payment received: 42,000 AED (at 4.20 rate)
- FX GAIN: 2,000 AED
```

### Use Case 3: Multi-Currency Business
```
Company operates in AED (base currency)

Scenario 1:
├─ Invoice: EUR 10,000
├─ Payment: AED 42,000
├─ Rate at payment: 4.20
└─ FX tracking: EUR → AED

Scenario 2:
├─ Invoice: EGP 100,000
├─ Payment: AED 7,480
├─ Rate at payment: 0.0748
└─ FX tracking: EGP → AED

Scenario 3:
├─ Invoice: USD 10,000
├─ Payment: USD 10,000
├─ Rate: 1.0
└─ No FX impact
```

## FX Gain/Loss Calculation

### Formula

```
FX Gain/Loss = (Payment Rate - Invoice Rate) × Amount in Invoice Currency
```

### Step-by-Step Calculation

```python
# Given:
invoice_amount = 10,000  # EUR
invoice_rate = 4.00      # 1 EUR = 4.00 AED (at posting)
payment_rate = 4.20      # 1 EUR = 4.20 AED (at payment)

# Step 1: Calculate booked amount
booked_amount = invoice_amount * invoice_rate
# = 10,000 × 4.00 = 40,000 AED

# Step 2: Calculate actual payment equivalent
payment_equivalent = invoice_amount * payment_rate
# = 10,000 × 4.20 = 42,000 AED

# Step 3: Calculate FX gain/loss
fx_gain_loss = payment_equivalent - booked_amount
# = 42,000 - 40,000 = 2,000 AED (GAIN)
```

### Another Way (Using Rate Difference)

```python
rate_difference = payment_rate - invoice_rate
# = 4.20 - 4.00 = 0.20

fx_gain_loss = invoice_amount * rate_difference
# = 10,000 × 0.20 = 2,000 AED (GAIN)
```

### Interpretation

| Scenario | Rate Movement | Result | Journal Entry |
|----------|--------------|--------|---------------|
| Payment rate > Invoice rate | Currency strengthened | **FX GAIN** | Debit: Cash, Credit: FX Gain |
| Payment rate < Invoice rate | Currency weakened | **FX LOSS** | Debit: Cash + FX Loss, Credit: AR |
| Payment rate = Invoice rate | No change | **No FX impact** | Standard entry |

## Integration with Accounting

### 1. At Payment Posting

When posting the payment to GL, use the stored exchange rate:

```python
def post_ar_payment(payment):
    """Post AR payment with FX consideration"""
    
    if payment.invoice_currency and payment.exchange_rate:
        # Cross-currency payment
        if payment.invoice_currency.id != payment.currency.id:
            # Calculate FX gain/loss
            for alloc in payment.allocations.all():
                invoice = alloc.invoice
                
                # Invoice was posted at invoice.exchange_rate
                # Payment received at payment.exchange_rate
                invoice_rate = invoice.exchange_rate or Decimal('1.0')
                payment_rate = payment.exchange_rate
                
                # Calculate FX impact
                amount_in_invoice_currency = alloc.amount / payment_rate
                fx_diff = (payment_rate - invoice_rate) * amount_in_invoice_currency
                
                if fx_diff > 0:
                    # FX Gain
                    JournalLine.objects.create(
                        entry=journal_entry,
                        account=fx_gain_account,
                        credit=abs(fx_diff)
                    )
                elif fx_diff < 0:
                    # FX Loss
                    JournalLine.objects.create(
                        entry=journal_entry,
                        account=fx_loss_account,
                        debit=abs(fx_diff)
                    )
```

### 2. FX Gain/Loss Report

Generate report of realized FX gains/losses:

```python
def fx_gain_loss_report(start_date, end_date):
    """Generate FX gain/loss report for period"""
    
    results = []
    
    # AR Payments
    ar_payments = ARPayment.objects.filter(
        date__range=[start_date, end_date],
        posted_at__isnull=False
    ).exclude(invoice_currency=F('currency'))
    
    for payment in ar_payments:
        for alloc in payment.allocations.all():
            invoice = alloc.invoice
            
            if invoice.exchange_rate and payment.exchange_rate:
                # Calculate FX gain/loss
                rate_diff = payment.exchange_rate - invoice.exchange_rate
                amount_in_inv_curr = alloc.amount / payment.exchange_rate
                fx_impact = amount_in_inv_curr * rate_diff
                
                results.append({
                    'date': payment.date,
                    'type': 'AR',
                    'reference': payment.reference,
                    'invoice': invoice.number,
                    'invoice_currency': payment.invoice_currency.code,
                    'payment_currency': payment.currency.code,
                    'invoice_rate': invoice.exchange_rate,
                    'payment_rate': payment.exchange_rate,
                    'fx_gain_loss': fx_impact
                })
    
    return results
```

## Comparison: Allocation vs Payment FX Fields

| Aspect | Allocation Fields | Payment Fields |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **Purpose** | Track each invoice's currency | Track overall payment FX impact |
| **Granularity** | Per invoice allocation | Per payment transaction |
| **Use Case** | Multi-invoice payments | FX gain/loss calculations |
| **When Used** | Detailed allocation tracking | Accounting and reporting |
| **Updates** | Auto-populated on save | Call update method explicitly |

### When to Use Which?

**Use Allocation Fields** when:
- Payment allocated to multiple invoices in different currencies
- Need detailed breakdown per invoice
- Tracking individual allocation rates

**Use Payment Fields** when:
- All invoices in same currency (different from payment)
- Need overall FX impact for accounting
- Generating FX gain/loss reports

**Use Both** for:
- Complete FX tracking
- Comprehensive reporting
- Audit trail requirements

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Update FX Fields After Allocations
```python
# Create payment and allocations
payment = ARPayment.objects.create(...)
ARPaymentAllocation.objects.create(payment=payment, invoice=inv1, ...)
ARPaymentAllocation.objects.create(payment=payment, invoice=inv2, ...)

# IMPORTANT: Update FX fields
payment.update_exchange_rate_from_allocations()
```

### 2. Check for Cross-Currency Before Processing
```python
if payment.invoice_currency and payment.invoice_currency.id != payment.currency.id:
    # Cross-currency payment - calculate FX impact
    calculate_fx_gain_loss(payment)
```

### 3. Automate in Payment Workflow
```python
def create_payment_with_allocations(payment_data, allocations_data):
    payment = ARPayment.objects.create(**payment_data)
    
    for alloc_data in allocations_data:
        ARPaymentAllocation.objects.create(payment=payment, **alloc_data)
    
    # Auto-update FX fields
    payment.update_exchange_rate_from_allocations()
    
    return payment
```

### 4. Include in Payment Serializer Create Method
```python
def create(self, validated_data):
    allocations_data = validated_data.pop('allocations', [])
    payment = ARPayment.objects.create(**validated_data)
    
    for alloc_data in allocations_data:
        ARPaymentAllocation.objects.create(payment=payment, **alloc_data)
    
    # Update FX tracking fields
    payment.update_exchange_rate_from_allocations()
    
    return payment
```
