# Currency Exchange Feature - Summary

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTED**

---

## üìã What Was Implemented

### Feature: Automatic Currency Conversion for Invoices

When posting AR/AP invoices to the General Ledger:
- ‚úÖ Automatically detects if invoice currency differs from base currency
- ‚úÖ Looks up exchange rate from `core.ExchangeRate` table
- ‚úÖ Converts all amounts to base currency
- ‚úÖ Posts GL entries in base currency only
- ‚úÖ Stores exchange rate and base currency total on invoice for audit trail

---

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Changes

### New Fields Added:

**ARInvoice Model** (`ar/models.py`):
```python
exchange_rate = DecimalField(18, 6)       # Rate used for conversion
base_currency_total = DecimalField(14, 2) # Total in base currency
```

**APInvoice Model** (`ap/models.py`):
```python
exchange_rate = DecimalField(18, 6)       # Rate used for conversion  
base_currency_total = DecimalField(14, 2) # Total in base currency
```

### Migrations Created:
- ‚úÖ `ar/migrations/0002_arinvoice_base_currency_total_and_more.py`
- ‚úÖ `ap/migrations/0002_apinvoice_base_currency_total_and_more.py`

## üíª Code Changes

### 1. AR Invoice Posting (`finance/services.py`)

**Function:** `gl_post_from_ar_balanced()`

**Enhanced to:**
1. Check if invoice currency = base currency
2. If different, fetch exchange rate from database
3. Convert subtotal, tax, and total to base currency
4. Create journal entry in **base currency** (not invoice currency)
5. Store conversion rate and base total on invoice
6. Update memo to show conversion: `"AR Post INV-001 (USD‚ÜíAED @ 3.670000)"`

### 2. AP Invoice Posting (`finance/services.py`)

**Function:** `gl_post_from_ap_balanced()`

**Enhanced to:**
- Same logic as AR but for supplier invoices
- Converts expense and tax amounts
- Posts to AP account instead of AR

---

## üîÑ How It Works

### Example: USD Invoice with AED Base Currency

**Before Posting:**
```
Invoice: INV-001
Customer: ABC Corp
Currency: USD
Subtotal: $1,000.00 USD
Tax (5%): $50.00 USD
Total: $1,050.00 USD
```

**System Actions:**
1. Detects invoice currency (USD) ‚â† base currency (AED)
2. Looks up exchange rate: 1 USD = 3.67 AED (from ExchangeRate table)
3. Converts amounts:
   - $1,000 √ó 3.67 = 3,670.00 AED
   - $50 √ó 3.67 = 183.50 AED
   - $1,050 √ó 3.67 = 3,853.50 AED

**Journal Entry Created (in AED):**
```
Date: 2025-01-15
Currency: AED
Memo: "AR Post INV-001 (USD‚ÜíAED @ 3.670000)"

DR  Accounts Receivable (1100)    3,853.50 AED
    CR  Sales Revenue (4000)               3,670.00 AED
    CR  VAT Payable (2100)                   183.50 AED
```

**Invoice Updated:**
```
status = 'POSTED'
exchange_rate = 3.670000
base_currency_total = 3853.50
gl_journal_id = 15
```

## üìä Key Benefits

1. **Single Base Currency:** All GL entries in one currency for easy reporting
2. **Audit Trail:** Original currency and rate stored on invoice
3. **Automatic:** No manual conversion needed
4. **IAS 21 Compliant:** Follows international accounting standards
5. **Flexible:** Supports any number of foreign currencies

---

## üéØ Usage

### Step 1: Configure Base Currency
```python
from core.models import Currency

aed = Currency.objects.get(code='AED')
aed.is_base = True
aed.save()
```

### Step 2: Create Exchange Rates
```python
from finance.fx_services import create_exchange_rate
from decimal import Decimal
from datetime import date

# USD to AED
create_exchange_rate('USD', 'AED', Decimal('3.67'), date.today())

# EUR to AED  
create_exchange_rate('EUR', 'AED', Decimal('4.02'), date.today())
```

### Step 3: Create & Post Invoice
```python
# Create invoice in USD
invoice = ARInvoice.objects.create(
    customer=customer,
    number='INV-001',
    date=date.today(),
    currency=Currency.objects.get(code='USD')
)

# Add items...
ARItem.objects.create(invoice=invoice, ...)

# Post (automatic conversion happens here)
from finance.services import gl_post_from_ar_balanced
je, created = gl_post_from_ar_balanced(invoice)

# Check results
print(f"Exchange Rate: {invoice.exchange_rate}")
print(f"Base Total: {invoice.base_currency_total}")
print(f"JE Currency: {je.currency.code}")  # Will be AED
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Next Steps to Use

### 1. Apply Migrations
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 2. Configure System
- Set one currency as `is_base=True`
- Add exchange rates to `core.ExchangeRate` table
- Ensure all accounts exist (AR, AP, REV, EXP, VAT_OUT, VAT_IN)

### 3. Test
- Create invoice in base currency (should use rate 1.0)
- Create invoice in foreign currency (should convert)
- Verify journal entries are balanced
- Check exchange rate and base total are saved

---

## üîç Verification

### Check if Working:
```python
from ar.models import ARInvoice

# Get a posted invoice
invoice = ARInvoice.objects.filter(status='POSTED').first()

print(f"Invoice Currency: {invoice.currency.code}")
print(f"Exchange Rate: {invoice.exchange_rate}")
print(f"Base Currency Total: {invoice.base_currency_total}")

if invoice.gl_journal:
    print(f"GL Entry Currency: {invoice.gl_journal.currency.code}")
    print(f"GL Entry Memo: {invoice.gl_journal.memo}")
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Invoice Currency: USD
Exchange Rate: 3.670000
Base Currency Total: 3670.00
GL Entry Currency: AED
GL Entry Memo: AR Post INV-001 (USD‚ÜíAED @ 3.670000)
```

## ‚úÖ Checklist

Before using in production:

- [ ] Apply migrations (`python manage.py migrate`)
- [ ] Set base currency (`is_base=True` on one currency)
- [ ] Create exchange rates for all currency pairs
- [ ] Test with base currency invoice (rate should be 1.0)
- [ ] Test with foreign currency invoice (should convert)
- [ ] Verify journal entries are balanced
- [ ] Verify exchange rate is saved on invoice
- [ ] Check GL entries are in base currency only
- [ ] Test with different dates (ensure correct rate is used)
