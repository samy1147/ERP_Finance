## 📝 Usage Example

### Creating a Customer
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/customers
2. Click "New Customer" button
3. Fill in the form:
   - Code: CUS-001 (optional)
   - Name: ABC Company (required)
   - Email: info@abc.com
   - Country: UAE
   - Currency ID: 1
   - VAT Number: 12345678 (optional)
   - Active: ✓ (checked)
4. Click "Create"
5. Customer appears in the list

### Creating a Supplier
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/suppliers
2. Click "New Supplier" button
3. Fill in the form:
   - Code: SUP-001 (optional)
   - Name: XYZ Supplies (required)
   - Email: sales@xyz.com

## 🔗 Integration with Invoices

Now when you create AR/AP invoices, you can:
1. First create a customer/supplier
2. Note their ID (shown in the table)
3. Use that ID when creating invoices

**Next improvement:** Update invoice forms to show dropdown of customers/suppliers instead of manual ID entry.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### About Duplicate Models
- The original CRM app had simple Customer/Supplier models
- AR/AP apps have more complete Customer/Supplier models with:
  - Customer code
  - Currency reference
  - VAT number
  - Country code
- **We're using the AR/AP models** because they're already integrated with invoices

### Database Tables
- Customers are stored in: `ar_customer`
- Suppliers are stored in: `ap_supplier`

## 🎯 Next Steps to Complete

### 1. Update Invoice Creation Forms
The AR/AP invoice forms still ask for "Customer ID" as a number. We should update them to:
- Fetch list of customers/suppliers
- Show dropdown with names
- Auto-fill customer code and details

### 2. Add More Fields
Consider adding:
- Phone number
- Address
- Credit limit
- Payment terms
- Contact person

### 3. Add Validation
- Unique customer/supplier codes
- Email format validation
- Required fields enforcement

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Failed to create" error
