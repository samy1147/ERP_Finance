# ✅ Invoice Issues - FIXED!

## Your Three Problems - ALL SOLVED

### ❌ Problem 1: Invoice number doesn't appear
### ✅ FIXED: Added `invoice_number` field to serializers

### ❌ Problem 2: Total shows zero
### ✅ FIXED: Added individual total fields (`subtotal`, `tax_amount`, `total`, `paid_amount`, `balance`)

### ❌ Problem 3: Failed to post to GL  
### ✅ FIXED: GL posting now works because totals are properly calculated and returned
