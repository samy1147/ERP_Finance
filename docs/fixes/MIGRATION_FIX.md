# Migration Issue Fixed âœ…

## Problem
When running `python manage.py makemigrations`, got error:
```
finance.Invoice.customer: (fields.E300) Field defines a relation with model 'crm.Customer', 
which is either not installed, or is abstract.
```

## Root Cause
- The `finance.Invoice` model had a ForeignKey to `crm.Customer`
- We removed the Customer model from CRM (to avoid duplication)
- Customers are now in `ar.Customer` (Accounts Receivable app)
- Suppliers are in `ap.Supplier` (Accounts Payable app)

## Solution Applied
Changed the reference in `finance/models.py`:
```python
# Before:
customer = models.ForeignKey("crm.Customer", on_delete=models.PROTECT)

# After:
customer = models.ForeignKey("ar.Customer", on_delete=models.PROTECT)
```

## Migrations Created
1. `finance/migrations/0014_alter_invoice_customer.py` - Updates Invoice.customer field
2. `crm/migrations/0002_delete_customer.py` - Removes old Customer model from CRM

## Status
âœ… Migrations created successfully
âœ… Migrations applied successfully
âœ… Django server running without errors
âœ… System check identified no issues

## Next Steps
You can now:
1. âœ… Access the Customers page: http://localhost:3000/customers
2. âœ… Access the Suppliers page: http://localhost:3000/suppliers
3. âœ… Create, edit, delete customers and suppliers
4. âœ… Use them in AR/AP invoices

## System is Ready! ðŸš€

Both backend and frontend are now working correctly.
