## üêõ Major Issues Fixed

### 1. Invoice Creation Issues
**Problem:** Three critical bugs:
- Invoice number not displaying (field name mismatch)
- Totals showing zero (items not being saved)
- GL posting failing (validation and endpoint issues)

**Root Cause:** Empty description fields in frontend causing items not to be saved to database.

**Solution:**
- Added frontend validation to reject empty descriptions
- Added backend validation to filter out empty descriptions
- Fixed field name mapping (number vs invoice_number)
- Added totals caching to prevent 6x recalculation
- Fixed GL posting endpoint URL and error handling

### 2. GL Posting Failures
**Problem:** "Failed to post" error with no details

**Root Cause:**
- Frontend calling wrong endpoint (`/post/` instead of `/post-gl/`)
- Frontend checking wrong error field (`error` instead of `detail`)

**Solution:**
- Fixed API endpoint URLs in frontend
- Updated error handling to check both `detail` and `error` fields
- Added proper error logging

### 3. Payment Form Issues
**Problem:** AR and AP payment forms not working

**Root Cause:**
- Wrong field names sent to backend (`payment_date` instead of `date`)
- Extra unnecessary fields (currency, reference_number, memo)
- Invoice not filtered by customer/supplier
- Type incompatibilities

**Solution:**
- Fixed field mapping to match backend models
- Added customer/supplier dropdowns
- Added invoice dropdown with proper filtering
- Made invoice required
- Auto-fill amount from invoice balance
- Fixed type imports
