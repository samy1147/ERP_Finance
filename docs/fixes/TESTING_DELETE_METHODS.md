- **Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### 3. ✅ AR Payments (`/ar/payments`)

- **Has:** Delete button
- **Function:** `handleDelete`
- **Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### 4. ✅ AP Invoices (`/ap/invoices`)
- **File:** `frontend/src/app/ap/invoices/page.tsx`
- **Has:** Delete button
- **Function:** `handleDelete`
- **Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### 5. ✅ AP Payments (`/ap/payments`)

## How to Fix Caching Issues

### Option 1: Hard Refresh Browser
```
1. Open the page (e.g., http://localhost:3000/ar/invoices)
2. Press Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows/Linux)
   or Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
3. This clears cache and reloads
```

### Option 2: Clear Browser Cache Completely
```
1. Press F12 to open DevTools
2. Right-click the Refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
```

### Option 3: Restart Next.js Dev Server
```powershell
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C in the terminal)
cd C:\Users\samys\FinanceERP\frontend
npm run dev
```

### Option 4: Delete Next.js Cache
```powershell
cd C:\Users\samys\FinanceERP\frontend
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next
npm run dev
```

## How to Verify Buttons Are Present

### Check 1: View Page Source
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/ar/invoices
2. Right-click → "View Page Source"
3. Search for "handleDelete" or "Trash2"
4. If found, buttons are there

### Check 2: Browser Console
1. Press F12
2. Go to Console tab
3. Type: `document.querySelectorAll('[title="Delete"]').length`
4. Should return the number of delete buttons

### Check 3: Inspect Element
1. Go to any invoice/payment list page
2. Create a DRAFT record first
3. Right-click on the Actions column
4. Select "Inspect"
5. You should see the delete button in the HTML

## What Delete Buttons Look Like

The delete buttons appear in the **Actions** column for **DRAFT status only**:

```
Actions Column:
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ [✓ Post to GL] [🗑️]    │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

- Green checkmark button = Post to GL
- Red trash icon = Delete

## Testing Steps

### Test AR Invoice Delete:
```
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/ar/invoices
2. Click "New Invoice"
3. Fill form and create invoice
4. Back on list page, find your invoice
5. Status should be "DRAFT"
6. You should see TWO buttons:
   - "Post to GL" (green)
   - Trash icon (red)
7. Click trash icon
8. Confirm deletion
9. Invoice should disappear
```

### Test AR Payment Delete:
```
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/ar/payments
2. Click "New Payment"
3. Create a payment
4. Back on list, status = "DRAFT"
5. See "Post" and trash icon
6. Click trash → Confirm → Deleted
```

### Test AP Invoice Delete:
```
Same as AR Invoice but at /ap/invoices
```

### Test AP Payment Delete:
```
Same as AR Payment but at /ap/payments
```

## Expected Button Behavior

### When Status = DRAFT:
✅ "Post to GL" button visible
✅ Delete (trash) button visible

### When Status = POSTED:
✅ Nothing in Actions column (no buttons)

### When Status = REVERSED:
✅ Nothing in Actions column (no buttons)

## Code Verification

You can verify the code exists by looking at these lines:

### AR Invoices (`frontend/src/app/ar/invoices/page.tsx`):
- Line 6: `import { Plus, FileText, CheckCircle, Trash2 } from 'lucide-react';`
- Line 46-59: `const handleDelete = async (id: number, invoiceNumber: string) => { ... }`
- Line 132: `onClick={() => handleDelete(invoice.id, invoice.invoice_number)}`

### AR Payments (`frontend/src/app/ar/payments/page.tsx`):
- Line 6: `import { Plus, CheckCircle, Trash2 } from 'lucide-react';`
- Line 46-59: `const handleDelete = async (id: number, amount: string) => { ... }`
- Line 130: `onClick={() => handleDelete(payment.id, payment.amount)}`

### AP Invoices (`frontend/src/app/ap/invoices/page.tsx`):
- Line 6: `import { Plus, FileText, CheckCircle, Trash2 } from 'lucide-react';`
- Line 46-59: `const handleDelete = async (id: number, invoiceNumber: string) => { ... }`
- Line 132: `onClick={() => handleDelete(invoice.id, invoice.invoice_number)}`

### AP Payments (`frontend/src/app/ap/payments/page.tsx`):
- Line 6: `import { Plus, CheckCircle, Trash2 } from 'lucide-react';`
- Line 46-59: `const handleDelete = async (id: number, amount: string) => { ... }`
- Line 130: `onClick={() => handleDelete(payment.id, payment.amount)}`

## Still Not Working?

If after hard refresh you still don't see the buttons, please:

1. **Check the console for errors:**
   - Press F12 → Console tab
   - Look for any red errors
   - Share the error message

2. **Verify you have DRAFT records:**
   - Delete buttons ONLY show for DRAFT status
   - Create a new invoice/payment
   - Make sure it's not posted yet

3. **Check the Actions column:**
   - Look at the table header
   - Confirm there's an "Actions" column
   - Look for records with status = DRAFT

4. **Restart everything:**
   ```powershell
   # Kill all node and python processes
   Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -match "node|python"} | Stop-Process -Force
   
   # Restart
   cd C:\Users\samys\FinanceERP
   .\venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py runserver
   
   # In another terminal
   cd C:\Users\samys\FinanceERP\frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

## Summary

✅ The code IS implemented
✅ Delete methods ARE in the files
✅ Delete buttons ARE in the UI (for DRAFT status)
✅ Most likely issue: Browser cache

**Try a hard refresh first: Ctrl + Shift + R**

If it still doesn't work, let me know what you see and I'll help debug!
