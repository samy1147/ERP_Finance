## Dashboard Integration

### Homepage Card Added
**File**: `frontend/src/app/page.tsx`

Added new dashboard card:
```tsx
<Link href="/invoice-approvals">
  <CheckCircle className="h-8 w-8 text-blue-600" />
  <h3>Invoice Approvals</h3>
  <p>Review & Approve</p>
</Link>
```

Location: Main dashboard grid with other module cards

## State Management

### Core State
```typescript
const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState<TabType>('pending');
const [invoiceTypeFilter, setInvoiceTypeFilter] = useState<InvoiceType>('all');
const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState('');
const [approvals, setApprovals] = useState<InvoiceApproval[]>([]);
const [selectedApprovals, setSelectedApprovals] = useState<number[]>([]);
const [showDetails, setShowDetails] = useState<number | null>(null);
const [invoiceDetails, setInvoiceDetails] = useState<ARInvoice | APInvoice | null>(null);
```

### Filter Logic
```typescript
// Three-level filtering
1. Tab filter (pending/approved/rejected/all)
2. Invoice type filter (all/AR/AP)
3. Search filter (invoice#, submitter, approver)

// Applied in sequence
filtered = approvals
  .filter(by_tab)
  .filter(by_type)
  .filter(by_search);
```
