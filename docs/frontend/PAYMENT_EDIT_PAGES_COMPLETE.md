# Payment Edit Pages - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented complete CRUD functionality for both AR and AP payments with comprehensive edit pages that allow modifying draft payments and their invoice allocations.

## Files Created

### 1. AR Payment Edit Page
- **Path**: `frontend/src/app/ar/payments/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
- **Lines**: 514 lines
- **Purpose**: Edit AR payments and allocate to customer invoices

### 2. AP Payment Edit Page
- **Path**: `frontend/src/app/ap/payments/[id]/edit/page.tsx`
- **Lines**: 514 lines (mirror of AR with supplier context)
- **Purpose**: Edit AP payments and allocate to supplier invoices

### 3. Payment List Updates
- **AR List**: `frontend/src/app/ar/payments/page.tsx` - Added Edit button
- **AP List**: `frontend/src/app/ap/payments/page.tsx` - Added Edit button

## Core Features (Both Pages)

### ✅ Payment Loading
- Fetches existing payment by ID from URL params
- Pre-fills all form fields with existing data
- Validates payment status (prevents editing posted payments)
- Redirects if payment is posted or not found

### ✅ Entity Locking
- Customer/Supplier field **disabled** (immutable)
- Reference field **disabled** (auto-generated, immutable)
- Rationale: Changing entity would invalidate allocations

### ✅ Allocation Management
- Loads outstanding invoices for customer/supplier
- Pre-selects invoices that have existing allocations
- Pre-fills allocation amounts from existing data
- Allows adding new allocations
- Allows removing existing allocations
- Allows modifying allocation amounts

### ✅ Real-Time Calculations
```typescript
// Total allocated across all selected invoices
const calculateTotalAllocated = () => {
  return invoices
    .filter(inv => inv.selected)
    .reduce((sum, inv) => sum + parseFloat(inv.amount || '0'), 0);
};

// Unallocated balance
const calculateUnallocated = () => {
  const total = parseFloat(formData.total_amount) || 0;
  const allocated = calculateTotalAllocated();
  return total - allocated;
};
```

### ✅ Validation Rules
1. Total payment amount > 0
2. At least one invoice allocation required
3. Allocation amount ≤ Invoice outstanding balance
4. Total allocations ≤ Payment amount
5. All amounts must be positive
6. Supplier/Customer cannot be empty

### ✅ User Interface Elements

**Payment Details Card**:
- Customer/Supplier (disabled)
- Payment Date (editable)
- Total Amount (editable)
- Currency (editable)
- Reference (disabled)
- Bank Account (editable)
- Memo (editable)

**Allocation Summary Panel** (Blue background):
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Total Payment    │ $1,000.00 (green)   │
│ Total Allocated  │ $800.00 (blue)      │
│ Unallocated      │ $200.00 (red/green) │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Invoice Allocations Table**:
- Checkboxes for selection
- Invoice numbers
- Invoice totals
- Outstanding balances
- Allocation amount inputs
- Clear All button

**Form Actions**:
- Cancel button (returns to list)
- Update Payment button (saves changes)

### ✅ Auto-Fill Behavior
When user selects an invoice:
- If amount is $0.00 or empty, auto-fills with outstanding balance
- If amount exists, preserves the value
- User can always manually override

### ✅ Loading States
- "Loading payment..." during initial fetch
- "Loading invoices..." during invoice fetch
- "Updating..." during form submission
- Disabled buttons during loading

### ✅ Error Handling
- Toast notifications for errors
- Validation error messages
- Redirect protection for posted payments
- Console logging for debugging

## API Integration

### AR Payment Edit
```typescript
// Load payment
GET /api/ar/payments/{id}/

// Load outstanding invoices
GET /api/outstanding-invoices/ar/?customer={id}

// Update payment
PATCH /api/ar/payments/{id}/
{
  "customer": 1,
  "date": "2025-10-15",
  "total_amount": "1000.00",
  "currency": 1,
  "bank_account": 1,
  "memo": "Updated memo",
  "allocations": [
    { "invoice": 5, "amount": "300.00" },
    { "invoice": 7, "amount": "500.00" }
  ]
}
```

### AP Payment Edit
```typescript
// Load payment
GET /api/ap/payments/{id}/

// Load outstanding invoices
GET /api/outstanding-invoices/ap/?supplier={id}

// Update payment
PATCH /api/ap/payments/{id}/
{
  "supplier": 1,
  "date": "2025-10-15",
  "total_amount": "1000.00",
  "currency": 1,
  "bank_account": 1,
  "memo": "Updated memo",
  "allocations": [
    { "invoice": 5, "amount": "300.00" },
    { "invoice": 7, "amount": "500.00" }
  ]
}
```

## Integration with Payment Lists

### Edit Button Added
Both AR and AP payment list pages now have Edit buttons:

```tsx
{!payment.posted_at && (
  <Link
    href={`/ar/payments/${payment.id}/edit`} // or /ap/payments/...
    className="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-900"
    title="Edit Payment"
  >
    <Edit2 className="h-4 w-4" />
  </Link>
)}
```

**Display Logic**:
- Only shows for draft payments (unposted)
- Blue pencil icon (Edit2 from lucide-react)
- Appears before Post button
- Tooltip: "Edit Payment"

## User Workflow

### Editing a Payment
1. Navigate to AR/AP payments list page
2. Click blue Edit icon next to a draft payment
3. System loads payment and outstanding invoices
4. Form shows existing values with pre-selected allocations
5. User modifies:
   - Payment date
   - Total amount
   - Currency
   - Bank account
   - Memo
   - Invoice allocations (add/remove/modify)
6. Real-time summary updates as changes are made
7. Click "Update Payment" to save
8. System validates all business rules
9. Success toast and redirect to payment list

### Validation Examples

**Success Case**:
```
Payment Total: $1,000.00
Allocations:
  - Invoice INV-001: $300.00 (Outstanding: $500.00) ✓
  - Invoice INV-002: $500.00 (Outstanding: $800.00) ✓
Total Allocated: $800.00 ✓
Unallocated: $200.00 ✓
Result: Saves successfully
```

**Error Case**:
```
Payment Total: $1,000.00
Allocations:
  - Invoice INV-001: $600.00 (Outstanding: $500.00) ✗
Error: "Allocation for invoice INV-001 exceeds outstanding balance"
```

## Differences Between AR and AP

| Aspect | AR (Accounts Receivable) | AP (Accounts Payable) |
|--------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| Entity | Customer | Supplier |
| API Base | `arPaymentsAPI` | `apPaymentsAPI` |
| Entity API | `customersAPI` | `suppliersAPI` |
| Outstanding API | `getByCustomer()` | `getBySupplier()` |
| Routes | `/ar/payments` | `/ap/payments` |
| Title | "Edit AR Payment" | "Edit AP Payment" |
| Description | "customer invoices" | "supplier invoices" |

**Implementation Note**: The two pages are structurally identical, differing only in entity references and UI labels. This consistency ensures maintainability and predictable user experience.

## Security & Business Rules

### Edit Restrictions
1. ✅ **Posted Payments**: Cannot be edited (immutable after posting)
2. ✅ **Entity Lock**: Cannot change customer/supplier (would break allocations)
3. ✅ **Reference Lock**: Cannot change auto-generated reference
4. ✅ **Over-Allocation**: Cannot allocate more than payment total
5. ✅ **Invoice Limit**: Cannot allocate more than invoice outstanding balance

### Audit Trail
- Original payment data preserved in database
- Only draft payments can be modified
- Posted payments require reversal workflow (not edit)

## Testing Guide

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Load Test**:
   - Navigate to payment edit page
   - Verify all fields load correctly
   - Verify existing allocations are pre-selected

2. **Edit Test**:
   - Change payment date → Should save
   - Change total amount → Should update summary
   - Change currency → Should save
   - Modify memo → Should save

3. **Allocation Test**:
   - Add new invoice → Should allow selection
   - Remove allocation → Should deselect
   - Modify amount → Should recalculate summary
   - Auto-fill test → Should fill outstanding balance

4. **Validation Test**:
   - Try over-allocating → Should show error
   - Try negative amount → Should show error
   - Try zero allocations → Should show error
   - Try exceeding invoice balance → Should show error

5. **Posted Payment Test**:
   - Try editing posted payment → Should redirect
   - Verify Edit button hidden for posted payments

6. **Cancel Test**:
   - Click Cancel → Should return to list without saving

7. **Success Test**:
   - Valid edit → Should save and redirect
   - Verify toast notification appears
   - Verify changes persisted in list

### API Testing
```bash
# Load payment
GET http://localhost:8000/api/ar/payments/1/

# Update payment
PATCH http://localhost:8000/api/ar/payments/1/
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "date": "2025-10-16",
  "total_amount": "1500.00",
  "allocations": [
    {"invoice": 1, "amount": "750.00"},
    {"invoice": 2, "amount": "750.00"}
  ]
}
```
