```

## Backend Integration

The frontend is fully integrated with your Django backend:

### API Endpoints Used

- `GET /api/accounts/` - List accounts
- `GET /api/ar/invoices/` - List AR invoices
- `POST /api/ar/invoices/` - Create AR invoice
- `POST /api/ar/invoices/{id}/post/` - Post AR invoice to GL
- `GET /api/ar/payments/` - List AR payments
- `POST /api/ar/payments/` - Create AR payment
- `POST /api/ar/payments/{id}/post/` - Post AR payment
- `GET /api/ap/invoices/` - List AP invoices
- `POST /api/ap/invoices/` - Create AP invoice
- `POST /api/ap/invoices/{id}/post/` - Post AP invoice to GL
- `GET /api/ap/payments/` - List AP payments
- `POST /api/ap/payments/` - Create AP payment
- `POST /api/ap/payments/{id}/post/` - Post AP payment
- `GET /api/reports/trial-balance/` - Trial balance report
- `GET /api/reports/ar-aging/` - AR aging report
- `GET /api/reports/ap-aging/` - AP aging report

### CORS Configuration

The Django backend is already configured to accept requests from `http://localhost:3000`:

```python
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = [
    "http://localhost:3000",
    "http://127.0.0.1:3000",
]
```

## Database Connection

The frontend connects to the same database as your Django backend through the REST API. All data operations are handled server-side:

- SQLite database: `db.sqlite3` (default)
- PostgreSQL: Configured via Django settings
- All CRUD operations go through Django ORM
- Data validation on both frontend and backend

## Navigation

The sidebar provides quick access to:
- ðŸ“Š Dashboard
- ðŸ“– Accounts (Chart of Accounts)
- ðŸ“„ AR Invoices
- ðŸ’µ AR Payments  
- ðŸ“‹ AP Invoices
- ðŸ’³ AP Payments
- ðŸ“ˆ Reports

## Responsive Design

The frontend is fully responsive and works on:
- Desktop (1024px+)
- Tablet (768px - 1023px)
- Mobile (320px - 767px)

The sidebar collapses on mobile with a hamburger menu.

## Development Tips

1. **Hot Reload**: Changes to code automatically reload the browser
2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides autocompletion and type checking
3. **API Errors**: Check browser console and Network tab for debugging
4. **Backend Required**: Ensure Django backend is running before starting frontend

## Production Build

To build for production:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

This creates an optimized build in `.next/` directory.

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If port 3000 is busy, the dev server will suggest an alternative port.

### API Connection Failed
- Verify Django backend is running on `http://localhost:8000`
- Check CORS settings in Django
- Verify API endpoints match your backend URLs

### Module Not Found
Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed.
